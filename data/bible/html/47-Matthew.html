<p id="matthew-13-26"><span class="verse-num">13:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the blade was sprung up, and had brought forth fruit, then appeared also the cockle.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-27"><span class="verse-num">13:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And the servants of the good man of the house coming said to him. Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? Whence then hath it cockle?</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-28"><span class="verse-num">13:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to them: An enemy hath done this. And the servants said to him: Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-29"><span class="verse-num">13:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said: No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-30"><span class="verse-num">13:30</span> <span class="verse-body">Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-31"><span class="verse-num">13:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Another parable he proposed unto them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-32"><span class="verse-num">13:32</span> <span class="verse-body">Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-33"><span class="verse-num">13:33</span> <span class="verse-body">Another parable he spoke to them: The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-34"><span class="verse-num">13:34</span> <span class="verse-body">All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes: and without parables he did not speak to them.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-35"><span class="verse-num">13:35</span> <span class="verse-body">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-36"><span class="verse-num">13:36</span> <span class="verse-body">Then having sent away the multitudes, he came into the house, and his disciples came to him, saying: Expound to us the parable of the cockle of the field.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-37"><span class="verse-num">13:37</span> <span class="verse-body">Who made answer and said to them: He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-38"><span class="verse-num">13:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And the field is the world. And the good seed are the children of the kingdom. And the cockle are the children of the wicked one.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-39"><span class="verse-num">13:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And the enemy that sowed them, is the devil. But the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-40"><span class="verse-num">13:40</span> <span class="verse-body">Even as cockle therefore is gathered up, and burnt with fire: so shall it be at the end of the world.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-41"><span class="verse-num">13:41</span> <span class="verse-body">The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and them that work iniquity.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-42"><span class="verse-num">13:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-43"><span class="verse-num">13:43</span> <span class="verse-body">Then shall the just shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-44"><span class="verse-num">13:44</span> <span class="verse-body">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field. Which a man having found, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-45"><span class="verse-num">13:45</span> <span class="verse-body">Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good pearls.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-46"><span class="verse-num">13:46</span> <span class="verse-body">Who when he had found one pearl of great price, went his way, and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-47"><span class="verse-num">13:47</span> <span class="verse-body">Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea, and gathering together of all kinds of fishes.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-48"><span class="verse-num">13:48</span> <span class="verse-body">Which, when it was filled, they drew out, and sitting by the shore, they chose out the good into vessels, but the bad they cast forth.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-49"><span class="verse-num">13:49</span> <span class="verse-body">So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall go out, and shall separate the wicked from among the just.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-50"><span class="verse-num">13:50</span> <span class="verse-body">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-51"><span class="verse-num">13:51</span> <span class="verse-body">Have ye understood all these things? They say to him: Yes.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-52"><span class="verse-num">13:52</span> <span class="verse-body">He said unto them: Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like to a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-53"><span class="verse-num">13:53</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass: when Jesus had finished these parables, he passed from thence.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-54"><span class="verse-num">13:54</span> <span class="verse-body">And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogues, so that they wondered and said: How came this man by this wisdom and miracles?</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-55"><span class="verse-num">13:55</span> <span class="verse-body">Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Jude:</span></p>

<p id="matthew-13-57"><span class="verse-num">13:57</span> <span class="verse-body">And they were scandalized in his regard. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-13-58"><span class="verse-num">13:58</span> <span class="verse-body">And he wrought not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.</span></p>

<p id="matthew-27-28"><span class="verse-num">27:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-29"><span class="verse-num">27:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, King of the Jews.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-30"><span class="verse-num">27:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And spitting upon him, they took the reed and struck his head.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-31"><span class="verse-num">27:31</span> <span class="verse-body">And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him and put on him his own garments and led him away to crucify him.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-32"><span class="verse-num">27:32</span> <span class="verse-body">And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-33"><span class="verse-num">27:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-34"><span class="verse-num">27:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-35"><span class="verse-num">27:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-36"><span class="verse-num">27:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And they sat and watched him.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-37"><span class="verse-num">27:37</span> <span class="verse-body">And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-38"><span class="verse-num">27:38</span> <span class="verse-body">Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand and one on the left.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-39"><span class="verse-num">27:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</span></p>

<p id="matthew-27-41"><span class="verse-num">27:41</span> <span class="verse-body">In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking said:</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-42"><span class="verse-num">27:42</span> <span class="verse-body">He saved others: himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross: and we will believe him.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-43"><span class="verse-num">27:43</span> <span class="verse-body">He trusted in God: let him now deliver him if he will have him. For he said: I am the Son of God.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-44"><span class="verse-num">27:44</span> <span class="verse-body">And the selfsame thing the thieves also that were crucified with him reproached him with.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-45"><span class="verse-num">27:45</span> <span class="verse-body">Now from the sixth hour, there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-46"><span class="verse-num">27:46</span> <span class="verse-body">And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? That is, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-47"><span class="verse-num">27:47</span> <span class="verse-body">And some that stood there and heard said: This man calleth Elias.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-48"><span class="verse-num">27:48</span> <span class="verse-body">And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-49"><span class="verse-num">27:49</span> <span class="verse-body">And the others said: Let be. Let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-50"><span class="verse-num">27:50</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-51"><span class="verse-num">27:51</span> <span class="verse-body">And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom: and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-52"><span class="verse-num">27:52</span> <span class="verse-body">And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,</span></p>

<p id="matthew-27-54"><span class="verse-num">27:54</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-55"><span class="verse-num">27:55</span> <span class="verse-body">And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</span></p>

<p id="matthew-27-58"><span class="verse-num">27:58</span> <span class="verse-body">He went to Pilate and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-59"><span class="verse-num">27:59</span> <span class="verse-body">And Joseph taking the body wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth:</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-60"><span class="verse-num">27:60</span> <span class="verse-body">And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument and went his way.</span></p>
<p id="matthew-27-61"><span class="verse-num">27:61</span> <span class="verse-body">And there was there Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</span></p>
