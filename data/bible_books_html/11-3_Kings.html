<p id="3-kings-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Now king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with clothes he was not warm.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">His servants therefore, said to him: Let us seek for our Lord the king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom and warm our lord the king.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">So they sought a beautiful young woman, in all the coasts of Israel and they found Abisag, a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And the damsel was exceedingly beautiful, and she slept with the king, and served him, but the king did not know her.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And Adonias, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying: I will be king.  And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done this?  And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after Absalom.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And he conferred with Joab, the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar, the priest, who furthered Adonias's side.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">But Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and Nathan, the prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David's army, was not with Adonias.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And Adonias having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all his brethren, the king's sons, and all the men of Juda, the king's servants:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">But Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, and all the valiant men, and Solomon, his brother, he invited not.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And Nathan said to Bethsabee, the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not heard that Adonias, the son of Haggith, reigneth, and our lord David knoweth it not?</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Now then, come, take my counsel, and save thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to me, thy handmaid, saying: Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth Adonias reign?</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after thee, and will fill up thy words.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber. Now the king was very old, and Abisag, the Sunamitess, ministered to him.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king said to her: What is thy will?</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">She answered, and said: My lord, thou didst swear to thy handmaid, by the Lord thy God, saying: Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And behold, now Adonias reigneth, and thou, my lord the king, knowest nothing of it.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">He hath killed oxen, and all fat cattle, and many rams, and invited all the king's sons, and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the general of the army: but Solomon, thy servant, he invited not.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And now, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the king, after thee.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I, and my son, Solomon, shall be accounted offenders.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan, the prophet, came.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And they told the king, saying: Nathan, the prophet, is here. And when he was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to the ground,</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Nathan said: My lord, O king, hast thou said: Let Adonias reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-25"><span class="verse-num">1:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Because he is gone down to day, and hath killed oxen, and fatlings, and many rams, and invited all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest: and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying: God save king Adonias:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-26"><span class="verse-num">1:26</span> <span class="verse-body">But me, thy servant, and Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and Solomon, thy servant, he hath not invited.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-27"><span class="verse-num">1:27</span> <span class="verse-body">Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not told me, thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-28"><span class="verse-num">1:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And king David answered, and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was come in to the king, and stood before him,</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-29"><span class="verse-num">1:29</span> <span class="verse-body">The king swore, and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-30"><span class="verse-num">1:30</span> <span class="verse-body">Even as I swore to thee, by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: Solomon thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-31"><span class="verse-num">1:31</span> <span class="verse-body">And Bethsabee, bowing with her face to the earth, worshipped the king, saying: May my lord David live for ever.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-32"><span class="verse-num">1:32</span> <span class="verse-body">King David also said: Call me Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, the son of Joiada.  And when they were come in before the king,</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-33"><span class="verse-num">1:33</span> <span class="verse-body">He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set my son Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-34"><span class="verse-num">1:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And let Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him there king over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: God save king Solomon.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-35"><span class="verse-num">1:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler over Israel, and over Juda.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-36"><span class="verse-num">1:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And Banaias, the son of Joiada, answered the king, saying: Amen: so say the Lord, the God of my lord the king.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-37"><span class="verse-num">1:37</span> <span class="verse-body">As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with Solomon, and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord king David.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-38"><span class="verse-num">1:38</span> <span class="verse-body">So Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, went down, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set Solomon upon the mule of king David, and brought him to Gihon.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-39"><span class="verse-num">1:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And Sadoc, the priest, took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon: and they sounded the trumpet, and all the people said: God save king Solomon.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-40"><span class="verse-num">1:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes, and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the noise of their cry.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-41"><span class="verse-num">1:41</span> <span class="verse-body">And Adonias, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now the feast was at an end. Joab also, hearing the sound of the trumpet, said: What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar?</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-42"><span class="verse-num">1:42</span> <span class="verse-body">While he yet spoke, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, the priest, came: and Adonias said to him: Come in, because thou art a valiant man, and bringest good news.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-43"><span class="verse-num">1:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jonathan answered Adonias: Not so: for our lord, king David, hath appointed Solomon king;</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-44"><span class="verse-num">1:44</span> <span class="verse-body">And hath sent with him Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and they have set him upon the king's mule:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-45"><span class="verse-num">1:45</span> <span class="verse-body">And Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king, in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again: this is the noise that you have heard.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-46"><span class="verse-num">1:46</span> <span class="verse-body">Moreover, Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-47"><span class="verse-num">1:47</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king's servants going in, have blessed our lord king David, saying: May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king adored in his bed:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-48"><span class="verse-num">1:48</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who hath given this day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing it.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-49"><span class="verse-num">1:49</span> <span class="verse-body">Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid, and they all arose, and every man went his way.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-50"><span class="verse-num">1:50</span> <span class="verse-body">And Adonias fearing Solomon, arose and went, and took hold of the horn of the altar.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-51"><span class="verse-num">1:51</span> <span class="verse-body">And they told Solomon, saying: Behold Adonias fearing king Solomon, hath taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-52"><span class="verse-num">1:52</span> <span class="verse-body">And Solomon said: If he be a good man, there shall not so much as one hair of his head fall to the ground: but if evil be found in him, he shall die.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-1-53"><span class="verse-num">1:53</span> <span class="verse-body">Then king Solomon sent, and brought him out from the altar: and going in, he worshipped king Solomon: and Solomon said to him: Go to thy house.</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son Solomon, saying:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage and shew thyself a man.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and observe his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses: that thou mayst understand all thou dost, and whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Sarvia, hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner, the son of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Do, therefore, according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to hell in peace.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai, the Galaadite, and let them eat at thy table: for they met me when I fled from the face of Absalom, thy brother.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou hast also with thee Semei, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to the camp: but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying: I will not kill thee with the sword:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise man, and knowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And Adonias, the son of Haggith, came to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon. And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? He answered: It is peaceable.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him: Speak. And he said:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had preferred me to be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is become my brother's: for it was appointed him by the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Now therefore, I ask one petition of thee; turn not away my face. And she said to him: Say on.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny thee any thing) to give me Abisag, the Sunamitess, to wife.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias: and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee; do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother ask, for I must not turn away thy face.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And she said: Let Abisag, the Sunamitess, be given to Adonias, thy brother, to wife.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag, the Sunamitess, for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom; for he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Sarvia.</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-5-4"><span class="verse-num">5:4</span> <span class="verse-body">But now the Lord my God hath given me rest round about; and there is no adversary nor evil occurrence.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-5"><span class="verse-num">5:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore I purpose to build a temple to the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spoke to David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon the throne, in thy place, he shall build a house to my name.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-6"><span class="verse-num">5:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Give orders, therefore, that thy servants cut me down cedar trees, out of Libanus, and let my servants be with thy servants: and I will give thee the hire of thy servants whatsoever thou wilt ask: for thou knowest how there is not among my people a man that has skill to hew wood like to the Sidonians.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-7"><span class="verse-num">5:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when Hiram had heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced exceedingly, and said: Blessed be the Lord God this day, who hath given to David a very wise son over this numerous people.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-8"><span class="verse-num">5:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have heard all thou hast desired of me; and I will do all thy desire concerning cedar trees, and fir trees.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-9"><span class="verse-num">5:9</span> <span class="verse-body">My servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: and I will put them together in floats, on the sea, and convey them to the place, which thou shalt signify to me, and will land them there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt allow me necessaries to furnish food for my household.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-10"><span class="verse-num">5:10</span> <span class="verse-body">So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees, and fir trees, according to all his desire.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-11"><span class="verse-num">5:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And Solomon allowed Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat, for provision for his house, and twenty measures of the purest oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram every year.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-12"><span class="verse-num">5:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they two made a league together.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-13"><span class="verse-num">5:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And king Solomon chose workmen out of all Israel, and the levy was of thirty thousand men.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-14"><span class="verse-num">5:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand every month, by turns, so that two months they were at home: and Adoniram was over this levy.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-15"><span class="verse-num">5:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And Solomon had seventy thousand to carry burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountain:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-16"><span class="verse-num">5:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Besides the overseers who were over every work, in number three thousand and three hundred, that ruled over the people, and them that did the work.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-17"><span class="verse-num">5:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king commanded that they should bring great stones, costly stones, for the foundation of the temple, and should square them:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-5-18"><span class="verse-num">5:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And the masons of Solomon, and the masons of Hiram, hewed them: and the Giblians prepared timber and stones to build the house.</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-6-7"><span class="verse-num">6:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And the house, when it was in building, was built of stones, hewed and made ready: so that there was neither hammer nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the house when it was in building.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-6-8"><span class="verse-num">6:8</span> <span class="verse-body">The door, for the middle side, was on the right hand of the house: and by winding stairs they went up to the middle room, and from the middle to the third.</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-6-15"><span class="verse-num">6:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And he built the walls of the house on the inside, with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house to the top of the walls, and to the roofs, he covered it with boards of cedar on the inside: and he covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-6-16"><span class="verse-num">6:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And he built up twenty cubits with boards of cedar at the hinder part of the temple, from the floor to the top: and made the inner house of the oracle to be the holy of holies.</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-6-25"><span class="verse-num">6:25</span> <span class="verse-body">The second cherub also was ten cubits: and the measure, and the work was the same in both the cherubims:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-6-26"><span class="verse-num">6:26</span> <span class="verse-body">That is to say, one cherub was ten cubits high, and in like manner the other cherub.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-6-27"><span class="verse-num">6:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And he set the cherubims in the midst of the inner temple: and the cherubims stretched forth their wings, and the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall: and the other wings in the midst of the temple touched one another.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-6-28"><span class="verse-num">6:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-6-29"><span class="verse-num">6:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the walls of the temple round about he carved with divers figures and carvings: and he made in them cherubims and palm trees, and divers representations, as it were standing out, and coming forth from the wall.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-6-30"><span class="verse-num">6:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And the floor of the house he also overlaid with gold within and without.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-6-31"><span class="verse-num">6:31</span> <span class="verse-body">And in the entrance of the oracle, he made little doors of olive tree, and posts of five corners,</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-21-20"><span class="verse-num">21:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And Achab said to Elias: Hast thou found me thy enemy?  He said: I have found thee because thou art sold, to do evil in the sight of the Lord.</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-21-22"><span class="verse-num">21:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahias: for what thou hast done to provoke me to anger, and for making Israel to sin.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-21-23"><span class="verse-num">21:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And of Jezabel also, the Lord spoke, saying: The dogs shall eat Jezabel in the field of Jezrahel.</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-21-25"><span class="verse-num">21:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Now, there was not such another as Achab, who was sold to do evil in the sight of the Lord: for his wife, Jezabel, set him on,</span></p>

<p id="3-kings-21-27"><span class="verse-num">21:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And when Achab had heard these words, he rent his garments, and put haircloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and slept in sackcloth, and walked with his head cast down.</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-21-28"><span class="verse-num">21:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:</span></p>
<p id="3-kings-21-29"><span class="verse-num">21:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Hast thou not seen Achab humbled before me? therefore, because he hath humbled himself, for my sake, I will not bring the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</span></p>
