<p id="1-corinthians-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span></p>

<p id="1-corinthians-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And I baptized also the household of Stephanus. Besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness: but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise: and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.</span></p>

<p id="1-corinthians-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">For, seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">For both the Jews require signs: and the Greeks seek after wisdom.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But we preach Christ crucified: unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-25"><span class="verse-num">1:25</span> <span class="verse-body">For the foolishness of God is wiser than men: and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-26"><span class="verse-num">1:26</span> <span class="verse-body">For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-27"><span class="verse-num">1:27</span> <span class="verse-body">But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise: and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-28"><span class="verse-num">1:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And the base things of the world and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen: and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-29"><span class="verse-num">1:29</span> <span class="verse-body">That no flesh should glory in his sight.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-30"><span class="verse-num">1:30</span> <span class="verse-body">But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption:</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-1-31"><span class="verse-num">1:31</span> <span class="verse-body">That, as it is written: He that glorieth may glory in the Lord.</span></p>

<p id="1-corinthians-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and him crucified.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power:</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Which none of the princes of this world knew. For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God, no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given us from God.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged of no man.</span></p>
<p id="1-corinthians-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span></p>
