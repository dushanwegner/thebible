<p id="romans-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the holy scriptures,</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the flesh,</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead:</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith, in all nations, for his name:</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">First, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all: because your faith is spoken of in the whole world.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you:</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you:</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you by that which is common to us both, your faith and mine.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you (and have been hindered hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth: to the Jew first and to the Greek.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice:</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Because that which is known of God is manifest in them.  For God hath manifested it unto them.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. His eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as God or given thanks: but became vain in their thoughts.  And their foolish heart was darkened.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">For, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts and of creeping things.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness: to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-25"><span class="verse-num">1:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-26"><span class="verse-num">1:26</span> <span class="verse-body">For this cause, God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-27"><span class="verse-num">1:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts, one towards another: men with men, working that which is filthy and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-28"><span class="verse-num">1:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-29"><span class="verse-num">1:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness: full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity: whisperers,</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-30"><span class="verse-num">1:30</span> <span class="verse-body">Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-31"><span class="verse-num">1:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Foolish, dissolute: without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.</span></p>
<p id="romans-1-32"><span class="verse-num">1:32</span> <span class="verse-body">Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death: and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.</span></p>

<p id="romans-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</span></p>

<p id="romans-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God:</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Who will render to every man according to his works.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">To them indeed who, according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">But to them that are contentious and who obey not the truth but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil: of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">But glory and honour and peace to every one that worketh good: to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For there is no respect of persons with God.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">For whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the law: and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">For not the hearers of the law are just before God: but the doers of the law shall be justified.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these, having not the law, are a law to themselves.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them: and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another,</span></p>

<p id="romans-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou, that sayest men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou, that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-23"><span class="verse-num">2:23</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou, that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-24"><span class="verse-num">2:24</span> <span class="verse-body">(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-25"><span class="verse-num">2:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-26"><span class="verse-num">2:26</span> <span class="verse-body">If then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-27"><span class="verse-num">2:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-28"><span class="verse-num">2:28</span> <span class="verse-body">For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly: nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh.</span></p>
<p id="romans-2-29"><span class="verse-num">2:29</span> <span class="verse-body">But he is a Jew that is one inwardly and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter: whose praise is not of men, but of God.</span></p>

<p id="romans-3-1"><span class="verse-num">3:1</span> <span class="verse-body">What advantage then hath the Jew: or what is the profit of circumcision?</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-2"><span class="verse-num">3:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-3"><span class="verse-num">3:3</span> <span class="verse-body">For what if some of them have not believed? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid!</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-4"><span class="verse-num">3:4</span> <span class="verse-body">But God is true and every man a liar, as it is written: That thou mayest be justified in thy words and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-5"><span class="verse-num">3:5</span> <span class="verse-body">But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-6"><span class="verse-num">3:6</span> <span class="verse-body">(I speak according to man.) God forbid! Otherwise how shall God judge this world?</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-7"><span class="verse-num">3:7</span> <span class="verse-body">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-8"><span class="verse-num">3:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And not rather (as we are slandered and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil that there may come good? Whose damnation is just.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-9"><span class="verse-num">3:9</span> <span class="verse-body">What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-10"><span class="verse-num">3:10</span> <span class="verse-body">As it is written: There is not any man just.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-11"><span class="verse-num">3:11</span> <span class="verse-body">There is none that understandeth: there is none that seeketh after God.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-12"><span class="verse-num">3:12</span> <span class="verse-body">All have turned out of the way: they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-13"><span class="verse-num">3:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-14"><span class="verse-num">3:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</span></p>

<p id="romans-3-19"><span class="verse-num">3:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Now we know that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law: that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be made subject to God.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-20"><span class="verse-num">3:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span></p>

<p id="romans-3-24"><span class="verse-num">3:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-25"><span class="verse-num">3:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-26"><span class="verse-num">3:26</span> <span class="verse-body">Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time: that he himself may be just and the justifier of him who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-27"><span class="verse-num">3:27</span> <span class="verse-body">Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law?  Of works? No, but by the law of faith.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-28"><span class="verse-num">3:28</span> <span class="verse-body">For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-29"><span class="verse-num">3:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? yes, of the Gentiles also.</span></p>
<p id="romans-3-30"><span class="verse-num">3:30</span> <span class="verse-body">For it is one God that justifieth circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith.</span></p>
