<p id="jude-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">For certain men are secretly entered in (who were written of long ago unto this judgment), ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God into riotousness and denying the only sovereign Ruler and our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things, that Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did afterwards destroy them that believed not.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their own habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains, unto the judgment of the great day.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">As Sodom and Gomorrha and the neighbouring cities, in like manner, having given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh, were made an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">In like manner, these men also defile the flesh and despise dominion and blaspheme majesty.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended about the body of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, but said: The Lord command thee.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not: and what things soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted.</span></p>

<p id="jude-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear, feeding themselves: clouds without water, which are carried about by winds: trees of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots:</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion: wandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Now of these Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying: Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints:</span></p>

<p id="jude-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">These are murmurers, full of complaints, walking according to their own desires: and their mouth speaketh proud things, admiring persons, for gain's sake.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">Who told you that in the last time there should come mockers, walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses.</span></p>

<p id="jude-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">But you, my beloved, building yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto life everlasting.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And some indeed reprove, being judged:</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But others save, pulling them out of the fire. And on others have mercy, in fear, hating also the spotted garment which is carnal.</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present you spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></p>
<p id="jude-1-25"><span class="verse-num">1:25</span> <span class="verse-body">To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and magnificence, empire and power, before all ages, and now, and for all ages of ages. Amen.</span></p>
