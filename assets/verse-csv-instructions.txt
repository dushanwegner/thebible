INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING VERSE CSV FOR "THE BIBLE" PLUGIN

1. Output UTF-8 CSV text only, inside a single Markdown code block for easy copy. Use this structure:

```csv
canonical_book_key,chapter,verse_from,verse_to
...your data rows here...
```

2. The first line INSIDE the code block MUST be this exact header (all lowercase, comma-separated):
   canonical_book_key,chapter,verse_from,verse_to

3. For each verse or verse range, output ONE CSV row with these rules:
   - canonical_book_key: one of the following canonical keys from book_map.json (exact spelling):
     genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, deuteronomy, josue, judges, ruth,
     job, psalms, proverbs, ecclesiastes, canticle-of-canticles,
     isaias, jeremias, lamentations, ezechiel, daniel, osee, joel, amos, abdias,
     jonas, micheas, nahum, habacuc, sophonias, aggeus, zacharias, malachias,
     matthew, mark, luke, john, acts, romans, 1-corinthians, 2-corinthians,
     galatians, ephesians, philippians, colossians, 1-thessalonians, 2-thessalonians,
     1-timothy, 2-timothy, titus, philemon, hebrews, james, 1-peter, 2-peter,
     1-john, 2-john, 3-john, jude, apocalypse.
   - chapter: positive integer chapter number (e.g. 3).
   - verse_from: positive integer first verse in the range (e.g. 16).
   - verse_to: last verse in the range (inclusive). If there is no range, leave this field empty.

4. The importer will automatically assign calendar dates from today forward, filling free days one per CSV row. Do NOT try to set dates in the CSV.

5. Example of TWO valid data lines (after the header):
   john,3,16,
   johannes,3,16,18

6. Do NOT add extra columns. Every row must have exactly four comma-separated fields matching the header.
