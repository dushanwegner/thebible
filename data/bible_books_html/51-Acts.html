<p id="acts-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place:</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming: and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And there appeared to them parted tongues, as it were of fire: and it sat upon every one of them.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost: and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these that speak Galilean?</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Parthians and Medes and Elamites and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another: What meaneth this?</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you and with your ears receive my words.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day:</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord), I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And upon my servants indeed and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit: and they shall prophesy.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord to come.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And it shalt come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you, as you also know:</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-23"><span class="verse-num">2:23</span> <span class="verse-body">This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-24"><span class="verse-num">2:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by it.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-25"><span class="verse-num">2:25</span> <span class="verse-body">For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-26"><span class="verse-num">2:26</span> <span class="verse-body">For this my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-27"><span class="verse-num">2:27</span> <span class="verse-body">Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell: nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-28"><span class="verse-num">2:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou hast made known to me the ways of life: thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-29"><span class="verse-num">2:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David: that he died and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this present say.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-30"><span class="verse-num">2:30</span> <span class="verse-body">Whereas therefore he was a prophet and knew that God hath sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his throne.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-31"><span class="verse-num">2:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ.  For neither was he left in hell: neither did his flesh see corruption.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-32"><span class="verse-num">2:32</span> <span class="verse-body">This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-33"><span class="verse-num">2:33</span> <span class="verse-body">Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this which you see and hear.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-34"><span class="verse-num">2:34</span> <span class="verse-body">For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand,</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-35"><span class="verse-num">2:35</span> <span class="verse-body">Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-36"><span class="verse-num">2:36</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-37"><span class="verse-num">2:37</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles: What shall we do, men and brethren?</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-38"><span class="verse-num">2:38</span> <span class="verse-body">But Peter said to them: Do penance: and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-39"><span class="verse-num">2:39</span> <span class="verse-body">For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-40"><span class="verse-num">2:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-41"><span class="verse-num">2:41</span> <span class="verse-body">They therefore that received his word were baptized: and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-42"><span class="verse-num">2:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in the communication of the breaking of bread and in prayers.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-43"><span class="verse-num">2:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And fear came upon every soul. Many wonders also and signs were done by the apostles in Jerusalem: and there was great fervor in all.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-44"><span class="verse-num">2:44</span> <span class="verse-body">And all they that believed were together and had all things common.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-45"><span class="verse-num">2:45</span> <span class="verse-body">Their possessions and goods they sold and divided them to all, according as every one had need.</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-46"><span class="verse-num">2:46</span> <span class="verse-body">And continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of heart:</span></p>
<p id="acts-2-47"><span class="verse-num">2:47</span> <span class="verse-body">Praising God and having favour with all the people. And the Lord increased daily together such as should be saved.</span></p>

<p id="acts-3-1"><span class="verse-num">3:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-2"><span class="verse-num">3:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was carried: whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-3"><span class="verse-num">3:3</span> <span class="verse-body">He, when he had seen Peter and John, about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-4"><span class="verse-num">3:4</span> <span class="verse-body">But Peter with John, fastening his eyes upon him, said: Look upon us.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-5"><span class="verse-num">3:5</span> <span class="verse-body">But he looked earnestly upon them, hoping that he should receive something of them.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-6"><span class="verse-num">3:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, I give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-7"><span class="verse-num">3:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up: and forthwith his feet and soles received strength.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-8"><span class="verse-num">3:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And he leaping up, stood and walked and went in with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-9"><span class="verse-num">3:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the people saw him walking and praising God.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-10"><span class="verse-num">3:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And they knew him, that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-11"><span class="verse-num">3:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran to them, to the porch which is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-12"><span class="verse-num">3:12</span> <span class="verse-body">But Peter seeing, made answer to the people: Ye men of Israel, why wonder you at this? Or why look you upon us, as if by our strength or power we had made this man to walk?</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-13"><span class="verse-num">3:13</span> <span class="verse-body">The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate, when he judged he should be released.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-14"><span class="verse-num">3:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But you denied the Holy One and the Just: and desired a murderer to be granted unto you.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-15"><span class="verse-num">3:15</span> <span class="verse-body">But the author of life you killed, whom God hath raised from the dead: of which we are witnesses.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-16"><span class="verse-num">3:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And in the faith of his name, this man, whom you have seen and known, hath his name strengthened. And the faith which is by him hath given this perfect soundness in the sight of you all.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-17"><span class="verse-num">3:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And now, brethren, I know that you did it through ignorance: as did also your rulers.</span></p>
<p id="acts-3-18"><span class="verse-num">3:18</span> <span class="verse-body">But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</span></p>

<p id="acts-16-9"><span class="verse-num">16:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And a vision was shewed to Paul in the night, which was a man of Macedonia standing and beseeching him and saying: Pass over into Macedonia and help us.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-10"><span class="verse-num">16:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia: being assured that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-11"><span class="verse-num">16:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And sailing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the day following to Neapolis.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-12"><span class="verse-num">16:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in this city some days conferring together.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-13"><span class="verse-num">16:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And upon the Sabbath day, we went forth without the gate by a river side, where it seemed that there was prayer: and sitting down, we spoke to the women that were assembled.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-14"><span class="verse-num">16:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, did hear: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to those things which were said by Paul.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-15"><span class="verse-num">16:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying: If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there. And she constrained us.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-16"><span class="verse-num">16:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain girl having a pythonical spirit met us, who brought to her masters much gain by divining.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-17"><span class="verse-num">16:17</span> <span class="verse-body">This same following Paul and us, cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the Most High God, who preach unto you the way of salvation.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-18"><span class="verse-num">16:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And this she did many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit: I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go from her. And he went out the same hour.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-19"><span class="verse-num">16:19</span> <span class="verse-body">But her masters, seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, apprehending Paul and Silas, brought them into the market place to the rulers.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-20"><span class="verse-num">16:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And presenting them to the magistrates, they said: These men disturb our city, being Jews:</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-21"><span class="verse-num">16:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive nor observe, being Romans.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-22"><span class="verse-num">16:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And the people ran together against them: and the magistrates, rending off their clothes, commanded them to be beaten with rods.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-23"><span class="verse-num">16:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the gaoler to keep them diligently.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-24"><span class="verse-num">16:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-25"><span class="verse-num">16:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And at midnight, Paul and Silas, praying, praised God. And they that were in prison heard them.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-26"><span class="verse-num">16:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and the bands of all were loosed.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-27"><span class="verse-num">16:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And the keeper of the prison, awakening out of his sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drawing his sword, would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-28"><span class="verse-num">16:28</span> <span class="verse-body">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying: Do thyself no harm, for we all are here.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-29"><span class="verse-num">16:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Then calling for a light, he went in: and trembling, fell down at the feet of Paul and Silas.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-30"><span class="verse-num">16:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And bringing them out, he said: Masters, what must I do, that I may be saved?</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-31"><span class="verse-num">16:31</span> <span class="verse-body">But they said: believe in the Lord Jesus: and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-32"><span class="verse-num">16:32</span> <span class="verse-body">And they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-33"><span class="verse-num">16:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And he, taking them the same hour of the night, washed their stripes: and himself was baptized, and all his house immediately.</span></p>

<p id="acts-16-35"><span class="verse-num">16:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the day was come, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying: Let those men go.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-36"><span class="verse-num">16:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And the keeper of the prison told these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart.  And go in peace.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-37"><span class="verse-num">16:37</span> <span class="verse-body">But Paul said to them: They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison.  And now do they thrust us out privately? Not so: but let them come.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-38"><span class="verse-num">16:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And let us out themselves. And the serjeants told these words to the magistrates. And they were afraid: hearing that they were Romans.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-39"><span class="verse-num">16:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And coming, they besought them: and bringing them out, they desired them to depart out of the city.</span></p>
<p id="acts-16-40"><span class="verse-num">16:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And they went out of the prison and entered into the house of Lydia: and having seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed.</span></p>

<p id="acts-17-1"><span class="verse-num">17:1</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-2"><span class="verse-num">17:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them. And for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures:</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-3"><span class="verse-num">17:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-4"><span class="verse-num">17:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And some of them believed and were associated to Paul and Silas: and of those that served God and of the Gentiles a great multitude: and of noble women not a few.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-5"><span class="verse-num">17:5</span> <span class="verse-body">But the Jews, moved with envy and taking unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar: and besetting Jason's house, sought to bring them out unto the people.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-6"><span class="verse-num">17:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar are come hither also:</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-7"><span class="verse-num">17:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Whom Jason hath received. And these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-8"><span class="verse-num">17:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And they stirred up the people: and the rulers of the city, hearing these things,</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-9"><span class="verse-num">17:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-10"><span class="verse-num">17:10</span> <span class="verse-body">But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-11"><span class="verse-num">17:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-12"><span class="verse-num">17:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And many indeed of them believed: and of honourable women that were Gentiles and of men, not a few.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-13"><span class="verse-num">17:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-14"><span class="verse-num">17:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-15"><span class="verse-num">17:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-16"><span class="verse-num">17:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-17"><span class="verse-num">17:17</span> <span class="verse-body">He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews and with them that served God: and in the market place, every day, with them that were there.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-18"><span class="verse-num">17:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him. And some said: What is it that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods. Because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-19"><span class="verse-num">17:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-20"><span class="verse-num">17:20</span> <span class="verse-body">For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-21"><span class="verse-num">17:21</span> <span class="verse-body">(Now all the Athenians and strangers that were there employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-22"><span class="verse-num">17:22</span> <span class="verse-body">But Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-23"><span class="verse-num">17:23</span> <span class="verse-body">For passing by and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the Unknown God. What therefore you worship without knowing it, that I preach to you:</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-24"><span class="verse-num">17:24</span> <span class="verse-body">God, who made the world and all things therein, he being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-25"><span class="verse-num">17:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Neither is he served with men's hands, as though he needed any thing: seeing it is he who giveth to all life and breath and all things:</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-26"><span class="verse-num">17:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times and the limits of their habitation.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-27"><span class="verse-num">17:27</span> <span class="verse-body">That they should seek God, if haply they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-28"><span class="verse-num">17:28</span> <span class="verse-body">For in him we live and move and are: as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-29"><span class="verse-num">17:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold or silver or stone, the graving of art and device of man.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-30"><span class="verse-num">17:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men that all should every where do penance.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-31"><span class="verse-num">17:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed: giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-32"><span class="verse-num">17:32</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked. But others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-33"><span class="verse-num">17:33</span> <span class="verse-body">So Paul went out from among them.</span></p>
<p id="acts-17-34"><span class="verse-num">17:34</span> <span class="verse-body">But certain men, adhering to him, did believe: among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.</span></p>

<p id="acts-18-2"><span class="verse-num">18:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And finding a certain Jew, named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome), he came to them.</span></p>
<p id="acts-18-3"><span class="verse-num">18:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and wrought. (Now they were tentmakers by trade.)</span></p>
<p id="acts-18-4"><span class="verse-num">18:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, bringing in the name of the Lord Jesus. And he persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</span></p>
<p id="acts-18-5"><span class="verse-num">18:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was earnest in preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</span></p>

<p id="acts-18-9"><span class="verse-num">18:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord said to Paul in the night, by a vision: Do not fear, but speak. And hold not thy peace,</span></p>

<p id="acts-19-1"><span class="verse-num">19:1</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-2"><span class="verse-num">19:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-3"><span class="verse-num">19:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John's baptism.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-4"><span class="verse-num">19:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance saying: That they should believe in him, who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-5"><span class="verse-num">19:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-6"><span class="verse-num">19:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them: and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-7"><span class="verse-num">19:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the men were about twelve.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-8"><span class="verse-num">19:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-9"><span class="verse-num">19:9</span> <span class="verse-body">But when some were hardened and believed not, speaking evil of the way of the Lord before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-10"><span class="verse-num">19:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And this continued for the space of two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Gentiles.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-11"><span class="verse-num">19:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-12"><span class="verse-num">19:12</span> <span class="verse-body">So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons: and the diseases departed from them: and the wicked spirits went out of them.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-13"><span class="verse-num">19:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Now some also of the Jewish exorcists, who went about, attempted to invoke over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-14"><span class="verse-num">19:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, that did this.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-15"><span class="verse-num">19:15</span> <span class="verse-body">But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them: Jesus I know: and Paul I know. But who are you?</span></p>

<p id="acts-19-17"><span class="verse-num">19:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt a Ephesus. And fear fell on them all: and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-18"><span class="verse-num">19:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And many of them that believed came, confessing and declaring their deeds.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-19"><span class="verse-num">19:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And many of them who had followed curious arts brought together their books and burnt them before all. And, counting the price of them, they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-20"><span class="verse-num">19:20</span> <span class="verse-body">So mightily grew the word of God and was confirmed.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-21"><span class="verse-num">19:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And when these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-22"><span class="verse-num">19:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in Asia.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-23"><span class="verse-num">19:23</span> <span class="verse-body">Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-24"><span class="verse-num">19:24</span> <span class="verse-body">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-25"><span class="verse-num">19:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Whom he calling together with the workmen of like occupation, said: Sirs, you know that our gain is by this trade.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-26"><span class="verse-num">19:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And you see and hear that this Paul, by persuasion hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying: they are not gods which are made by hands.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-27"><span class="verse-num">19:27</span> <span class="verse-body">So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing! Yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-28"><span class="verse-num">19:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Having heard these things, they were full of anger and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-29"><span class="verse-num">19:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And the whole city was filled with confusion. And having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-30"><span class="verse-num">19:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-31"><span class="verse-num">19:31</span> <span class="verse-body">And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-32"><span class="verse-num">19:32</span> <span class="verse-body">Now some cried one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused: and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-33"><span class="verse-num">19:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction,</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-34"><span class="verse-num">19:34</span> <span class="verse-body">But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for the space of about two, hours, cried out: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-35"><span class="verse-num">19:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana and of Jupiter's offspring?</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-36"><span class="verse-num">19:36</span> <span class="verse-body">For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-37"><span class="verse-num">19:37</span> <span class="verse-body">For you have brought hither these men, who are neither guilty of sacrilege nor of blasphemy against your goddess.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-38"><span class="verse-num">19:38</span> <span class="verse-body">But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a matter against any man, the courts of justice are open: and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-39"><span class="verse-num">19:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful assembly.</span></p>
<p id="acts-19-40"><span class="verse-num">19:40</span> <span class="verse-body">For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we may give account) of this concourse. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</span></p>

<p id="acts-25-12"><span class="verse-num">25:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou appealed to Caesar? To Caesar shalt thou go.</span></p>

<p id="acts-25-17"><span class="verse-num">25:17</span> <span class="verse-body">When therefore they were come hither, without any delay, on the day following, sitting in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.</span></p>

<p id="acts-25-20"><span class="verse-num">25:20</span> <span class="verse-body">I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question, asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these things.</span></p>
<p id="acts-25-21"><span class="verse-num">25:21</span> <span class="verse-body">But Paul, appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I might send him to Caesar.</span></p>
<p id="acts-25-22"><span class="verse-num">25:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the man, myself. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</span></p>

<p id="acts-25-25"><span class="verse-num">25:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</span></p>

<p id="acts-27-2"><span class="verse-num">27:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with us.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-3"><span class="verse-num">27:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And the day following, we came to Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends and to take care of himself.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-4"><span class="verse-num">27:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-5"><span class="verse-num">27:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And sailing over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Lystra, which is in Lycia.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-6"><span class="verse-num">27:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And there, the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, removed us into it.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-7"><span class="verse-num">27:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And when for many days we had sailed slowly and were scarce come over against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed near Crete by Salmone.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-8"><span class="verse-num">27:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And with much ado sailing by it, we came into a certain place, which is called Good-havens, nigh to which was the city of Thalassa.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-9"><span class="verse-num">27:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And when much time was spent and when sailing now was dangerous, because the fast was now past, Paul comforted them,</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-10"><span class="verse-num">27:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Saying to them: Ye men, I see that the voyage beginneth to be with injury and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-11"><span class="verse-num">27:11</span> <span class="verse-body">But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship, more than those things which were said by Paul.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-12"><span class="verse-num">27:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, the greatest part gave counsel to sail thence, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter there, which is a haven of Crete, looking towards the southwest and northwest.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-13"><span class="verse-num">27:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And the south wind gently blowing, thinking that they had obtained their purpose, when they had loosed from Asson, they sailed close by Crete.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-14"><span class="verse-num">27:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroaquilo.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-15"><span class="verse-num">27:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the ship was caught and could not bear up against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-16"><span class="verse-num">27:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And running under a certain island that is called Cauda, we had much work to come by the boat.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-17"><span class="verse-num">27:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Which being taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they let down the sail yard and so were driven.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-18"><span class="verse-num">27:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And we, being mightily tossed with the tempest, the next day they lightened the ship.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-19"><span class="verse-num">27:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And the third day they cast out with their own hands the tacking of the ship.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-20"><span class="verse-num">27:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no small storms lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-21"><span class="verse-num">27:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And after they had fasted a long time, Paul standing forth in the midst of them, said: You should indeed, O ye men, have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete and have gained this harm and loss.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-22"><span class="verse-num">27:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. For there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but only of the ship.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-23"><span class="verse-num">27:23</span> <span class="verse-body">For an angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night,</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-24"><span class="verse-num">27:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Saying: Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar; and behold, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-25"><span class="verse-num">27:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall so be, as it hath been told me.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-26"><span class="verse-num">27:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And we must come unto a certain island.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-27"><span class="verse-num">27:27</span> <span class="verse-body">But after the fourteenth night was come, as we were sailing in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they discovered some country.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-28"><span class="verse-num">27:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms: and going on a little further, they found fifteen fathoms.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-29"><span class="verse-num">27:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern: and wished for the day.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-30"><span class="verse-num">27:30</span> <span class="verse-body">But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship, having let down the boat into the sea, under colour, as though they would have cast anchors out of the forepart of the ship,</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-31"><span class="verse-num">27:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: Except these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-32"><span class="verse-num">27:32</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-33"><span class="verse-num">27:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And when it began to be light, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying: This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited and continued fasting, taking nothing.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-34"><span class="verse-num">27:34</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, I pray you to take some meat for your health's sake: for there shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-35"><span class="verse-num">27:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he had said these things, taking bread, he gave thanks to God in the sight of them all. And when he had broken it, he began to eat.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-36"><span class="verse-num">27:36</span> <span class="verse-body">Then were they all of better cheer: and they also took some meat.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-37"><span class="verse-num">27:37</span> <span class="verse-body">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-38"><span class="verse-num">27:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting the wheat into the sea.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-39"><span class="verse-num">27:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And when it was day, they knew not the land. But they discovered a certain creek that had a shore, into which they minded, if they could, to thrust in the ship.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-40"><span class="verse-num">27:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder bands. And hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, they made towards shore.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-41"><span class="verse-num">27:41</span> <span class="verse-body">And when we were fallen into a place where two seas met, they run the ship aground. And the forepart indeed, sticking fast, remained unmoveable: but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the sea.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-42"><span class="verse-num">27:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any of them, swimming out should escape.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-43"><span class="verse-num">27:43</span> <span class="verse-body">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, forbade it to be done. And he commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and save themselves and get to land.</span></p>
<p id="acts-27-44"><span class="verse-num">27:44</span> <span class="verse-body">And the rest, some they carried on boards and some on those things that belonged to the ship. And so it came to pass that every soul got safe to land.</span></p>

<p id="acts-28-1"><span class="verse-num">28:1</span> <span class="verse-body">And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. But the barbarians shewed us no small courtesy.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-2"><span class="verse-num">28:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, because of the present rain and of the cold.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-3"><span class="verse-num">28:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks and had laid them on the fire, a viper, coming out of the heat, fastened on his hand.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-4"><span class="verse-num">28:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand, they said one to another: Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, who, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-5"><span class="verse-num">28:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And he indeed, shaking off the beast into the fire, suffered no harm.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-6"><span class="verse-num">28:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But they supposed that he would begin to swell up and that he would suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their minds, they said that he was a god.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-7"><span class="verse-num">28:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Now in these places were possessions of the chief man of the island, named Publius: who, receiving us for three days, entertained us courteously.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-8"><span class="verse-num">28:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux. To whom Paul entered in. And when he had prayed and laid his hands on him, he healed him.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-9"><span class="verse-num">28:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Which being done, all that had diseases in the island came and were healed.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-10"><span class="verse-num">28:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Who also honoured us with many honours: and when we were to set sail, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-11"><span class="verse-num">28:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And after three months, we sailed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was the Castors.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-12"><span class="verse-num">28:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And when we were come to Syracusa, we tarried there three days.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-13"><span class="verse-num">28:13</span> <span class="verse-body">From thence, compassing by the shore, we came to Rhegium: and after one day, the south wind blowing, we came the second day to Puteoli:</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-14"><span class="verse-num">28:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Where, finding brethren, we were desired to tarry with them seven days. And so we went to Rome.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-15"><span class="verse-num">28:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns.  Whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God and took courage.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-16"><span class="verse-num">28:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And when we were come to Rome, Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-17"><span class="verse-num">28:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And after the third day, he called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were assembled, he said to them: Men, brethren, I, having done nothing against the people or the custom of our fathers, was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-18"><span class="verse-num">28:18</span> <span class="verse-body">Who, when they had examined me, would have released me, for that there was no cause of death in me.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-19"><span class="verse-num">28:19</span> <span class="verse-body">But the Jews contradicting it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar: not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-20"><span class="verse-num">28:20</span> <span class="verse-body">For this cause therefore I desired to see you and to speak to you. Because that for the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-21"><span class="verse-num">28:21</span> <span class="verse-body">But they said to him: We neither received letters concerning thee from Judea: neither did any of the brethren that came hither relate or speak any evil of thee.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-22"><span class="verse-num">28:22</span> <span class="verse-body">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that it is every where contradicted.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-23"><span class="verse-num">28:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had appointed him a day, there came very many to him unto his lodgings. To whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God and persuading them concerning Jesus, out of the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning until evening.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-24"><span class="verse-num">28:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And some believed the things that were said: but some believed not.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-25"><span class="verse-num">28:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, Paul speaking this one word: Well did the Holy Ghost speak to our fathers by Isaias the prophet,</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-26"><span class="verse-num">28:26</span> <span class="verse-body">Saying: Go to this people and say to them: With the ear you shall hear and shall not understand: and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-27"><span class="verse-num">28:27</span> <span class="verse-body">For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears have they heard heavily and their eyes they have shut, lest perhaps they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted: and I should heal them.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-28"><span class="verse-num">28:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Be it known therefore to you that this salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles: and they will hear it.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-29"><span class="verse-num">28:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he had said these things, the Jews went out from him, having much reasoning among themselves.</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-30"><span class="verse-num">28:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging: and he received all that came in to him,</span></p>
<p id="acts-28-31"><span class="verse-num">28:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, without prohibition.</span></p>
