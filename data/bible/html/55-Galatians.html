<p id="galatians-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead:</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the brethren who are with me: to the churches of Galatia.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Which is not another: only there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">For neither did I receive it of man: nor did I learn it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and wasted it.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And I made progress in the Jew's religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">But when it pleased him who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace,</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles: immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter: and I tarried with him fifteen days.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Afterwards, I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past doth now preach the faith which once he impugned.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And they glorified God in me.</span></p>

<p id="galatians-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And I went up according to revelation and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles: but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">To whom we yielded not by subjection: no, not for an hour: that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man): for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented: so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">We by nature are Jews: and not of the Gentiles, sinners.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid!</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God; with Christ I am nailed to the cross.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And I live, now not I: but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and delivered himself for me.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain.</span></p>

<p id="galatians-3-1"><span class="verse-num">3:1</span> <span class="verse-body">O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth: before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-2"><span class="verse-num">3:2</span> <span class="verse-body">This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-3"><span class="verse-num">3:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Are you so foolish that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-4"><span class="verse-num">3:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-5"><span class="verse-num">3:5</span> <span class="verse-body">He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you: doth he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of the faith?</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-6"><span class="verse-num">3:6</span> <span class="verse-body">As it is written: Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-7"><span class="verse-num">3:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Know ye, therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-8"><span class="verse-num">3:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And the scripture, foreseeing that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-9"><span class="verse-num">3:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore, they that are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-10"><span class="verse-num">3:10</span> <span class="verse-body">For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one that abideth, not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-11"><span class="verse-num">3:11</span> <span class="verse-body">But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-12"><span class="verse-num">3:12</span> <span class="verse-body">But the law is not of faith: but he that doth those things shall live in them.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-13"><span class="verse-num">3:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree).</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-14"><span class="verse-num">3:14</span> <span class="verse-body">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-15"><span class="verse-num">3:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Brethren (I speak after the manner of man), yet a man's testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth nor addeth to it.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-16"><span class="verse-num">3:16</span> <span class="verse-body">To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not: And to his seeds as of many. But as of one: And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-17"><span class="verse-num">3:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Now this I say: that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-18"><span class="verse-num">3:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-19"><span class="verse-num">3:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-20"><span class="verse-num">3:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-21"><span class="verse-num">3:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Was the law then against the promises of God: God forbid!  For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-22"><span class="verse-num">3:22</span> <span class="verse-body">But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-23"><span class="verse-num">3:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-24"><span class="verse-num">3:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ: that we might be justified by faith.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-25"><span class="verse-num">3:25</span> <span class="verse-body">But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-26"><span class="verse-num">3:26</span> <span class="verse-body">For you are all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-27"><span class="verse-num">3:27</span> <span class="verse-body">For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-28"><span class="verse-num">3:28</span> <span class="verse-body">There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-3-29"><span class="verse-num">3:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.</span></p>

<p id="galatians-4-10"><span class="verse-num">4:10</span> <span class="verse-body">You observe days and months and times, and years.</span></p>

<p id="galatians-4-23"><span class="verse-num">4:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman was by promise.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-4-24"><span class="verse-num">4:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from Mount Sina, engendering unto bondage, which is Agar.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-4-25"><span class="verse-num">4:25</span> <span class="verse-body">For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is: and is in bondage with her children.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-4-26"><span class="verse-num">4:26</span> <span class="verse-body">But that Jerusalem which is above is free: which is our mother.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-4-27"><span class="verse-num">4:27</span> <span class="verse-body">For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-4-28"><span class="verse-num">4:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-4-29"><span class="verse-num">4:29</span> <span class="verse-body">But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was after the spirit: so also it is now.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-4-30"><span class="verse-num">4:30</span> <span class="verse-body">But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.</span></p>
<p id="galatians-4-31"><span class="verse-num">4:31</span> <span class="verse-body">So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.</span></p>
