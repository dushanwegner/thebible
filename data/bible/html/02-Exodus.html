<p id="exodus-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,</span></p>
<p id="exodus-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:</span></p>
<p id="exodus-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.</span></p>

<p id="exodus-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.</span></p>

<p id="exodus-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And she conceived, and bore a son: and seeing him a goodly child, hid him three months.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink,</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river's brink.

<p id="exodus-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">She opened it, and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it, she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And the child's sister said to her: Shall I go, and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And Pharao's daughter said to her: Take this child, and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's daughter.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">In those days, after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews, his brethren.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us? wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known?</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And Pharao heard of this word, and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper, hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-23"><span class="verse-num">2:23</span> <span class="verse-body">Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-24"><span class="verse-num">2:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></p>
<p id="exodus-2-25"><span class="verse-num">2:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.</span></p>
