<p id="2-esdras-nehemias-13-8"><span class="verse-num">13:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And it seemed to me exceeding evil. And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.</span></p>
<p id="2-esdras-nehemias-13-9"><span class="verse-num">13:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And I commanded and they cleansed again the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense.</span></p>
<p id="2-esdras-nehemias-13-10"><span class="verse-num">13:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men, and they that ministered were fled away every man to his own country:</span></p>
<p id="2-esdras-nehemias-13-11"><span class="verse-num">13:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said: Why have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them together, and I made them to stand in their places.</span></p>

<p id="2-esdras-nehemias-13-22"><span class="verse-num">13:22</span> <span class="verse-body">I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day: for this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</span></p>

<p id="2-esdras-nehemias-13-26"><span class="verse-num">13:26</span> <span class="verse-body">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing: and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin.</span></p>
<p id="2-esdras-nehemias-13-27"><span class="verse-num">13:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to transgress against our God, and marry strange women:</span></p>
