<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">There was a man of Ramathaimsophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraimite:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And he had two wives, the name of one was Anna, and the name of the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but Anna had no children.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days, to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. And the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there priests of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the day came, and Elcana offered sacrifice, and gave to Phenenna, his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow, because he loved Anna. And the Lord had shut up her womb.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Her rival also afflicted her, and troubled her exceedingly, insomuch that she upbraided her, that the Lord had shut up her womb:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And thus she did every year, when the time returned, that they went up to the temple of the Lord: and thus she provoked her: but Anna wept, and did not eat.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Elcana, her husband, said to her: Anna, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? and why dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo: And Heli, the priest, sitting upon a stool before the door of the temple of the Lord;</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">As Anna had her heart full of grief, she prayed to the Lord, shedding many tears,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And she made a vow, saying: O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt look down, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a manchild: I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Heli observed her mouth.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be drunk,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And said to her: How long wilt thou be drunk? digest a little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy woman, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And she said: Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in thy eyes. So the woman went on her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more changed.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And they rose in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife: And the Lord remembered her.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass when the time was come about, Anna conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel: because she had asked him of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And Elcana, her husband, went up, and all his house, to offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice, and his vow.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">But Anna went not up: for she said to her husband: I will not go till the child be weaned, and till I may carry him, that he may appear before the Lord, and may abide always there.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And Elcana, her husband, said to her: Do what seemeth good to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I pray that the Lord may fulfil his word. So the woman staid at home, and gave her son suck, till she weaned him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And after she had weaned him, she carried him with her, with three calves, and three bushels of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. Now the child was as yet very young:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-25"><span class="verse-num">1:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-26"><span class="verse-num">1:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And Anna said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord: I am that woman, who stood before thee here praying to the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-27"><span class="verse-num">1:27</span> <span class="verse-body">For this child did I pray, and the Lord hath granted me my petition, which I asked of him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-1-28"><span class="verse-num">1:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life, he shall be lent to the Lord. And they adored the Lord there. And Anna prayed, and said:</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting: let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, and to him are thoughts prepared.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">The bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are girt with strength.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">They that were full before, have hired out themselves for bread: and the hungry are filled, so that the barren hath borne many: and she that had many children is weakened.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to hell, and bringeth back again.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he humbleth and he exalteth:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">He raiseth up the needy from the dust, and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill: that he may sit with princes, and hold the throne of glory. For the poles of the earth are the Lord's, and upon them he hath set the world.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; because no man shall prevail by his own strength.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens: The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, and shall exalt the horn of his Christ.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his house: but the child ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the priest.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing the Lord,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Nor the office of the priests to the people: but whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came, while the flesh was in boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And thrust it into the kettle, or into the cauldron, or into the pot, or into the pan: and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took to himself. Thus did they to all Israel that came to Silo.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest came, and said to the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil for the priest: for I will not take of thee sodden flesh, but raw.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And he that sacrificed said to him: Let the fat first be burnt to day, according to the custom, and then take to thee as much as thy soul desireth. But he answered, and said to him: Not so: but thou shalt give it me now, or else I will take it by force.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord: because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord: being a child girded with a linen ephod.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And his mother made him a little coat, which she brought to him on the appointed days, when she went up with her husband, to offer the solemn sacrifice.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife: and he said to him: The Lord give thee seed of this woman, for the loan thou hast lent to the Lord. And they went to their own home.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived, and bore three sons, and two daughters: and the child Samuel became great before the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Now Heli was very old, and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel: and how they lay with the women that waited at the door of the tabernacle:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-23"><span class="verse-num">2:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to them: Why do ye these kinds of things, which I hear, very wicked things, from all the people?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-24"><span class="verse-num">2:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Do not so, my sons: for it is no good report that I hear, that you make the people of the Lord to transgress.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-25"><span class="verse-num">2:25</span> <span class="verse-body">If one man shall sin against another, God may be appeased in his behalf: but if a man shall sin against the Lord, who shall pray for him? And they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-26"><span class="verse-num">2:26</span> <span class="verse-body">But the child Samuel advanced, and grew on, and pleased both the Lord and men.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-27"><span class="verse-num">2:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And there came a man of God to Heli, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Did I not plainly appear to thy father's house, when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharao?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-28"><span class="verse-num">2:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, and burn incense to me, and to wear the ephod before me: and I gave to thy father's house of all the sacrifices of the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-29"><span class="verse-num">2:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Why have you kicked away my victims, and my gifts which I commanded to be offered in the temple: and thou hast rather honoured thy sons than me, to eat the firstfruits of every sacrifice of my people Israel?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-30"><span class="verse-num">2:30</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should minister in my sight, for ever. But now saith the Lord: Far be this from me: but whosoever shall glorify me, him will I glorify: but they that despise me, shall be despised.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-31"><span class="verse-num">2:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Behold the days come: and I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-32"><span class="verse-num">2:32</span> <span class="verse-body">And thou shalt see thy rival in the temple, in all the prosperity of Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-33"><span class="verse-num">2:33</span> <span class="verse-body">However, I will not altogether take away a man of thee from my altar: but that thy eyes may faint, and thy soul be spent: and a great part of thy house shall die, when they come to man's estate.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-34"><span class="verse-num">2:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees: in one day they shall both of them die.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-35"><span class="verse-num">2:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And I will raise me up a faithful priest, who shall do according to my heart, and my soul and I will build him a faithful house, and he shall walk all days before my anointed.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-2-36"><span class="verse-num">2:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall remain in thy house shall come that he may be prayed for, and shall offer a piece of silver, and a roll of bread, and shall say: Put me, I beseech thee, to somewhat of the priestly office, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-3-3"><span class="verse-num">3:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Before the lamp of God went out, Samuel slept in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-3-4"><span class="verse-num">3:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord called Samuel. And he answered: Here am I.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-9-25"><span class="verse-num">9:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And they went down from the high place into the town, and he spoke with Saul upon the top of the house: and he prepared a bed for Saul on the top of the house and he slept.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-9-27"><span class="verse-num">9:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And as they were going down in the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: Speak to the servant to go before us, and pass on: but stand thou still a while, that I may tell thee the word of the Lord.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-14-46"><span class="verse-num">14:46</span> <span class="verse-body">And Saul went back, and did not pursue after the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own places.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-15-23"><span class="verse-num">15:23</span> <span class="verse-body">Because it is like the sin of witchcraft, to rebel: and like the crime of idolatry, to refuse to obey.

<p id="1-kings-samuel-15-27"><span class="verse-num">15:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And Samuel turned about to go away: but he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-15-28"><span class="verse-num">15:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And Samuel said to him: The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to thy neighbour who is better than thee.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-15-29"><span class="verse-num">15:29</span> <span class="verse-body">But the triumpher in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance: for he is not a man that he should repent.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-2"><span class="verse-num">16:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And Samuel said: How shall I go? for Saul will hear of it, and he will kill me. And the Lord said: Thou shalt take with thee a calf of the herd, and thou shalt say: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-3"><span class="verse-num">16:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And thou shalt call Isai to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou art to do, and thou shalt anoint him whom I shall shew to thee.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-4"><span class="verse-num">16:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Samuel did as the Lord had said to him. And he came to Bethlehem, and the ancients of the city wondered, and meeting him, they said: Is thy coming hither peaceable?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-5"><span class="verse-num">16:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said: It is peaceable: I am come to offer sacrifice to the Lord, be ye sanctified, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Isai and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-6"><span class="verse-num">16:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they were come in, he saw Eliab, and said: Is the Lord's anointed before him?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-7"><span class="verse-num">16:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord said to Samuel: Look not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature: because I have rejected him, nor do I judge according to the look of man: for man seeth those things that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-8"><span class="verse-num">16:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And Isai called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. And he said: Neither hath the Lord chosen this,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-9"><span class="verse-num">16:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And Isai brought Samma, and he said of him: Neither hath the Lord chosen this.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-10"><span class="verse-num">16:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Isai therefore brought his seven sons before Samuel: and Samuel said to Isai: The Lord hath not chosen any one of these.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-11"><span class="verse-num">16:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And Samuel said to Isai: Are here all thy sons? He answered: There remaineth yet a young one, who keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Isai: Send, and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-12"><span class="verse-num">16:12</span> <span class="verse-body">He sent therefore and brought him. Now he was ruddy and beautiful to behold, and of a comely face. And the Lord said: Arise, and anoint him, for this is he.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-13"><span class="verse-num">16:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward: and Samuel rose up, and went to Ramatha.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-14"><span class="verse-num">16:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-15"><span class="verse-num">16:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And the servants of Saul said to him: Behold now an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-16"><span class="verse-num">16:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Let our lord give orders, and thy servants who are before thee, will seek out a man skilful in playing on the harp, that when the evil spirit from the Lord is upon thee, he may play with his hand, and thou mayst bear it more easily.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-17"><span class="verse-num">16:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And Saul said to his servants: Provide me then some man that can play well, and bring him to me.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-18"><span class="verse-num">16:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And one of the servants answering, said: Behold I have seen a son of Isai, the Bethlehemite, a skilful player, and one of great strength, and a man fit for war, and prudent in his words, and a comely person: and the Lord is with him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-19"><span class="verse-num">16:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Saul sent messengers to Isai, saying: Send me David, thy son, who is in the pastures.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-20"><span class="verse-num">16:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And Isai took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid of the flock, and sent them by the hand of David, his son, to Saul.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-21"><span class="verse-num">16:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him exceedingly, and made him his armourbearer.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-22"><span class="verse-num">16:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And Saul sent to Isai, saying: Let David stand before me: for he hath found favour in my sight.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-16-23"><span class="verse-num">16:23</span> <span class="verse-body">So whensoever the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul, David took his harp, and played with his hand, and Saul was refreshed, and was better, for the evil spirit departed from him.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-1"><span class="verse-num">17:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the Philistines gathering together their troops to battle, assembled at Socho of Juda: and camped between Socho and Azeca, in the borders of Dommim.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-2"><span class="verse-num">17:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And Saul and the children of Israel being gathered together, came to the valley of Terebinth, and they set the army in array to fight against the Philistines.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-3"><span class="verse-num">17:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-4"><span class="verse-num">17:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And there went out a man baseborn from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Geth, whose height was six cubits and a span:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-5"><span class="verse-num">17:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clothed with a coat of mail with scales, and the weight of his coat of mail was five thousand sicles of brass:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-6"><span class="verse-num">17:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And he had greaves of brass on his legs, and a buckler of brass covered his shoulders.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-7"><span class="verse-num">17:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred sicles of iron: and his armourbearer went before him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-8"><span class="verse-num">17:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And standing, he cried out to the bands of Israel, and said to them: Why are you come out prepared to fight? am not I a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul?

<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-9"><span class="verse-num">17:9</span> <span class="verse-body">If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, we will be servants to you: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, you shall be servants, and shall serve us.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-10"><span class="verse-num">17:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Philistine said: I have defied the bands of Israel this day: give me a man, and let him fight with me hand to hand.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-11"><span class="verse-num">17:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And Saul and all the Israelites hearing these words of the Philistine, were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-12"><span class="verse-num">17:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Now David was the son of that Ephrathite, of Bethlehem Juda, before mentioned, whose name was Isai, who had eight sons, and was an old man in the days of Saul, and of great age among men.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-13"><span class="verse-num">17:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And his three eldest sons followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle, were Eliab, the firstborn, and the second, Abinadab, and the third Samma:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-14"><span class="verse-num">17:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But David was the youngest. So the three eldest having followed Saul,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-15"><span class="verse-num">17:15</span> <span class="verse-body">David went, and returned from Saul, to feed his father's flock at Bethlehem.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-16"><span class="verse-num">17:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the Philistine came out morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-17"><span class="verse-num">17:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And Isai said to David, his son: Take for thy brethren an ephi of frumenty, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-18"><span class="verse-num">17:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And carry these ten little cheeses to the tribune: and go see thy brethren, if they are well: and learn with whom they are placed.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-19"><span class="verse-num">17:19</span> <span class="verse-body">But Saul, and they, and all the children of Israel, were in the valley of Terebinth, fighting against the Philistines.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-20"><span class="verse-num">17:20</span> <span class="verse-body">David, therefore, arose in the morning, and gave the charge of the flock to the keeper: and went away loaded, as Isai had commanded him. And he came to the place of Magala, and to the army, which was going out to fight, and shouted for the battle.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-21"><span class="verse-num">17:21</span> <span class="verse-body">For Israel had put themselves in array, and the Philistines who stood against them were prepared.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-22"><span class="verse-num">17:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And David leaving the vessels which he had brought, under the care of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the place of the battle, and asked if all things went well with his brethren.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-23"><span class="verse-num">17:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And as he talked with them, that baseborn man, whose name was Goliath, the Philistine, of Geth, shewed himself coming up from the camp of the Philistines: and he spoke according to the same words, and David heard them,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-24"><span class="verse-num">17:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the Israelites, when they saw the man, fled from his face, fearing him exceedingly.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-25"><span class="verse-num">17:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And some one of Israel said: Have you seen this man that is come up, for he is come up to defy Israel. And the man that shall slay him, the king will enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and will make his father's house free from tribute in Israel.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-26"><span class="verse-num">17:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: What shall be given to the man that shall kill this Philistine, and shall take away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-27"><span class="verse-num">17:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And the people answered him the same words, saying: These things shall be given to the man that shall slay him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-28"><span class="verse-num">17:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when Eliab his eldest brother heard this, when he was speaking with others, he was angry with David, and said: Why camest thou hither? and why didst thou leave those few sheep in the desert? I know thy pride, and the wickedness of thy heart: that thou art come down to see the battle.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-29"><span class="verse-num">17:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And David said: What have I done? is there not cause to speak?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-30"><span class="verse-num">17:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And he turned a little aside from him to another: and said the same word. And the people answered him as before.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-31"><span class="verse-num">17:31</span> <span class="verse-body">And the words which David spoke were heard, and were rehearsed before Saul.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-32"><span class="verse-num">17:32</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he was brought to Saul, he said to him. Let not any man's heart be dismayed in him: I thy servant will go, and will fight against the Philistine.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-33"><span class="verse-num">17:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And Saul said to David: Thou art not able to withstand this Philistine, nor to fight against him: for thou art but a boy, but he is a warrior from his youth.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-34"><span class="verse-num">17:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And David said to Saul: Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of the flock:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-35"><span class="verse-num">17:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered it out of their mouth: and they rose up against me, and I caught them by the throat, and I strangled, and killed them.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-36"><span class="verse-num">17:36</span> <span class="verse-body">For I thy servant have killed both a lion and a bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be also as one of them. I will go now, and take away the reproach of the people: for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, who hath dared to curse the army of the living God?</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-37"><span class="verse-num">17:37</span> <span class="verse-body">And David said: The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David: Go, and the Lord be with thee.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-38"><span class="verse-num">17:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And Saul clothed David with his garments, and put a helmet of brass upon his head, and armed him with a coat of mail.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-39"><span class="verse-num">17:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And David having girded his sword upon his armour, began to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it. And he laid them off,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-40"><span class="verse-num">17:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands: and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them into the shepherd's scrip, which he had with him, and he took a sling in his hand, and went forth against the Philistine.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-41"><span class="verse-num">17:41</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Philistine came on, and drew nigh against David, and his armourbearer went before him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-42"><span class="verse-num">17:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the Philistine looked, and beheld David, he despised him. For he was a young man, ruddy, and of a comely countenance.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-43"><span class="verse-num">17:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Philistine said to David: Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a staff? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-44"><span class="verse-num">17:44</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to David: Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-45"><span class="verse-num">17:45</span> <span class="verse-body">And David said to the Philistine: Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, which thou hast defied.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-46"><span class="verse-num">17:46</span> <span class="verse-body">This day, and the Lord will deliver thee into my hand, and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from thee: and I will give the carcasses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-47"><span class="verse-num">17:47</span> <span class="verse-body">And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for it is his battle, and he will deliver you into our hands.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-48"><span class="verse-num">17:48</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the Philistine arose, and was coming, and drew nigh to meet David, David made haste, and ran to the fight to meet the Philistine.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-49"><span class="verse-num">17:49</span> <span class="verse-body">And he put his hand into his scrip, and took a stone, and cast it with the sling, and fetching it about, struck the Philistine in the forehead, and he fell on his face upon the earth.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-50"><span class="verse-num">17:50</span> <span class="verse-body">And David prevailed over the Philistine, with a sling and a stone, and he struck, and slew the Philistine. And as David had no sword in his hand,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-51"><span class="verse-num">17:51</span> <span class="verse-body">He ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head. And the Philistines seeing that their champion was dead, fled away.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-52"><span class="verse-num">17:52</span> <span class="verse-body">And the men of Israel and Juda rising up shouted, and pursued after the Philistines till they came to the valley and to the gates of Accaron, and there fell many wounded of the Philistines in the way of Saraim, and as far as Geth, and as far as Accaron.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-53"><span class="verse-num">17:53</span> <span class="verse-body">And the children of Israel returning, after they had pursued the Philistines, fell upon their camp.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-17-55"><span class="verse-num">17:55</span> <span class="verse-body">Now at the time that Saul saw David going out against the Philistines, he said to Abner, the captain of the army: Of what family is this young man descended, Abner?

<p id="1-kings-samuel-20-42"><span class="verse-num">20:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jonathan said to David: Go in peace: and let all stand that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying: The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.</span></p>

<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-1"><span class="verse-num">30:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when David and his men were come to Siceleg on the third day, the Amalecites had made an invasion on the south side upon Siceleg, and had smitten Siceleg, and burnt it with fire,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-2"><span class="verse-num">30:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And had taken the women captives that were in it, both little and great: and they had not killed any person, but had carried them with them, and went on their way.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-3"><span class="verse-num">30:3</span> <span class="verse-body">So when David and his men came to the city, and found it burnt with fire, and that their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-4"><span class="verse-num">30:4</span> <span class="verse-body">David and the people that were with him, lifted up their voices, and wept till they had no more tears.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-5"><span class="verse-num">30:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For the two wives also of David were taken captives, Achinoam, the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-6"><span class="verse-num">30:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And David was greatly afflicted: for the people had a mind to stone him, for the soul of every man was bitterly grieved for his sons and daughters: but David took courage in the Lord his God.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-7"><span class="verse-num">30:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to Abiathar, the priest, the son of Achimelech: Bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-8"><span class="verse-num">30:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I pursue after these robbers, and shall I overtake them, or not? And the Lord said to him: Pursue after them: for thou shalt surely overtake them and recover the prey.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-9"><span class="verse-num">30:9</span> <span class="verse-body">So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came to the torrent Besor: and some, being weary, stayed there.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-10"><span class="verse-num">30:10</span> <span class="verse-body">But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed, who, being weary, could not go over the torrent Besor.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-11"><span class="verse-num">30:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David: and they gave him bread to eat, and water to drink,</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-12"><span class="verse-num">30:12</span> <span class="verse-body">As also a piece of a cake of figs, and two bunches of raisins. And when he had eaten them, his spirit returned, and he was refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunk water, three days and three nights.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-13"><span class="verse-num">30:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And David said to him: To whom dost thou belong; or whence dost thou come? and whither art thou going? He said: I am a young man of Egypt, the servant of an Amalecite: and my master left me, because I began to be sick three days ago.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-14"><span class="verse-num">30:14</span> <span class="verse-body">For we made an invasion on the south side of Cerethi, and upon Juda, and upon the south of Caleb, and we burnt Siceleg with fire.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-15"><span class="verse-num">30:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And David said to him: Canst thou bring me to this company? and he said: Swear to me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee to this company. And David swore to him.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-16"><span class="verse-num">30:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he had brought him, behold they were lying spread abroad upon all the ground, eating and drinking, and as it were keeping a festival day, for all the prey and the spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-17"><span class="verse-num">30:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And David slew them from the evening unto the evening of the next day, and there escaped not a man of them, but four hundred young men, who had gotten upon camels, and fled.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-18"><span class="verse-num">30:18</span> <span class="verse-body">So David recovered all that the Amalecites had taken, and he rescued his two wives.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-19"><span class="verse-num">30:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And there was nothing missing small or great, neither of their sons or their daughters, nor of the spoils, and whatsoever they had taken, David recovered all.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-20"><span class="verse-num">30:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And he took all the flocks and the herds, and made them go before him: and they said: This is the prey of David.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-21"><span class="verse-num">30:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And David came to the two hundred men, who, being weary, had stayed, and were not able to follow David, and he had ordered them to abide at the torrent Besor: and they came out to meet David, and the people that were with him. And David coming to the people, saluted them peaceably.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-22"><span class="verse-num">30:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Then all the wicked and unjust men, that had gone with David, answering, said: Because they came not with us, we will not give them any thing of the prey which we have recovered: but let every man take his wife, and his children, and be contented with them, and go his way.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-23"><span class="verse-num">30:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But David said: You shall not do so, my brethren, with these things, which the Lord hath given us, who hath kept us, and hath delivered the robbers that invaded us into our hands:</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-24"><span class="verse-num">30:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And no man shall hearken to you in this matter. But equal shall be the portion of him that went down to battle, and of him that abode at the baggage, and they shall divide alike.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-25"><span class="verse-num">30:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And this hath been done from that day forward, and since was made a statute and an ordinance, and as a law in Israel.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-26"><span class="verse-num">30:26</span> <span class="verse-body">Then David came to Siceleg, and sent presents of the prey to the ancients of Juda, his neighbours, saying: Receive a blessing of the prey of the enemies of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="1-kings-samuel-30-27"><span class="verse-num">30:27</span> <span class="verse-body">To them that were in Bethel, and that were in Ramoth to the south, and to them that were in Jether.</span></p>
