<p id="james-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">James, the servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations:</span></p>
<p id="james-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience</span></p>
<p id="james-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And patience hath a perfect work: that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men abundantly and upbraideth not. And it shall be given him.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</span></p>
<p id="james-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And the rich, in his being low: because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass: and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished. So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for, when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love him.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils: and he tempteth no man.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of alteration.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creature.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak and slow to anger.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, casting away all uncleanness and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-25"><span class="verse-num">1:25</span> <span class="verse-body">But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work: this man shall be blessed in his deed.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-26"><span class="verse-num">1:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</span></p>
<p id="james-1-27"><span class="verse-num">1:27</span> <span class="verse-body">Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep one's self unspotted from this world.</span></p>

<p id="james-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory, with respect of persons.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel; and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire:</span></p>
<p id="james-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel and shall say to him: Sit thou here well: but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or: Sit under my footstool:</span></p>
<p id="james-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Hearken, my dearest brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? And do not they draw you before the judgment seats?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For he that said: Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also: Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">So speak ye and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy.  And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food:</span></p>
<p id="james-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works.  Shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Seest thou that faith did cooperate with his works and by works faith was made perfect?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-23"><span class="verse-num">2:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.</span></p>
<p id="james-2-24"><span class="verse-num">2:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Do you see that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-25"><span class="verse-num">2:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers and sending them out another way?</span></p>
<p id="james-2-26"><span class="verse-num">2:26</span> <span class="verse-body">For even as the body without the spirit is dead: so also faith without works is dead.</span></p>

<p id="james-3-2"><span class="verse-num">3:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.</span></p>

<p id="james-3-7"><span class="verse-num">3:7</span> <span class="verse-body">For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of the rest is tamed and hath been tamed, by the nature of man.</span></p>

<p id="james-3-14"><span class="verse-num">3:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contention in your hearts: glory not and be not liars against the truth.</span></p>
<p id="james-3-15"><span class="verse-num">3:15</span> <span class="verse-body">For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.</span></p>
<p id="james-3-16"><span class="verse-num">3:16</span> <span class="verse-body">For where envying and contention is: there is inconstancy and every evil work.</span></p>
<p id="james-3-17"><span class="verse-num">3:17</span> <span class="verse-body">But the wisdom that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.</span></p>
