<p id="daniel-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">In the third year of the reign of Joakim, king of Juda, Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem, and beseiged it.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord delivered into his hands Joakim, the king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the house of God: and he carried them away into the land of Sennaar, to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure house of his god.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king spoke to Asphenez, the master of the eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes,</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Children in whom there was no blemish, well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, acute in knowledge, and instructed in science, and such as might stand in the king's palace, that he might teach them the learning, and tongue of the Chaldeans.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king appointed them a daily provision, of his own meat, and of the wine of which he drank himself, that being nourished three years, afterwards they might stand before the king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Now there was among them of the children of Juda, Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And the master of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Baltassar: to Ananias, Sidrach: to Misael, Misach: and to Azarias, Abdenago.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with the king's table, nor with the wine which he drank: and he requested the master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And God gave to Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel: I fear my lord, the king, who hath appointed you meat and drink: who if he should see your faces leaner than those of the other youths, your equals, you shall endanger my head to the king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel said to Malasar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Try, I beseech thee, thy servants for ten days, and let pulse be given us to eat, and water to drink:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And look upon our faces, and the faces of the children that eat of the king's meat: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he had heard these words, he tried them for ten days.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And after ten days, their faces appeared fairer and fatter than all the children that ate of the king's meat.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">So Malasar took their portions, and the wine that they should drink: and he gave them pulse.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And to these children God gave knowledge, and understanding in every book, and wisdom: but to Daniel the understanding also of all visions and dreams.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the days were ended, after which the king had ordered they should be brought in: the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the king had spoken to them, there were not found among them all such as Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias: and they stood in the king's presence.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the diviners, and wise men, that were in all his kingdom.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">In the second year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuchodonosor had a dream, and his spirit was terrified, and his dream went out of his mind.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise men, and the magicians, and the Chaldeans: to declare to the king his dreams: so they came and stood before the king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said to them: I saw a dream: and being troubled in mind I know not what I saw.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac: O king, live for ever: tell to thy servants thy dream, and we will declare the interpretation thereof.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king, answering, said to the Chaldeans: The thing is gone out of my mind: unless you tell me the dream, and the meaning thereof, you shall be put to death, and your houses shall be confiscated.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">but if you tell the dream, and the meaning of it, you shall receive of me rewards, and gifts, and great honour: therefore, tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">They answered again and said: Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation of it.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">The king answered and said: I know for certain, that you seek to gain time, since you know that the thing is gone from me.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">If, therefore, you tell me not the dream, there is one sentence concerning you, that you have also framed a lying interpretation, and full of deceit, to speak before me till the time pass away. Tell me, therefore, the dream, that I may know that you also give a true interpretation thereof.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: There is no man upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king; neither doth any king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any diviner, or wise man, or Chaldean.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For the thing that thou asketh, O king, is difficult: nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Upon hearing this, the king in fury, and in great wrath, commanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And the decree being gone forth, the wise men were slain: and Daniel and his companions were sought for, to be put to death.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence, of Arioch, the general of the king's army, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king. And when Arioch had told the matter to Daniel,</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Daniel went in, and desired of the king, that he would give him time to resolve the question, and declare it to the king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And he went into his house, and told the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias, his companions:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of heaven, concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night: and Daniel blessed the God of heaven,</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And speaking, he said: Blessed be the name of the Lord from eternity and for evermore: for wisdom and fortitude are his.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And he changeth times and ages: taketh away kingdoms, and establisheth them: giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">He revealeth deep and hidden things, and knoweth what is in darkness: and light is with him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-23"><span class="verse-num">2:23</span> <span class="verse-body">To thee, O God of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee: because thou hast given me wisdom and strength: and now thou hast shewn me what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us the king's discourse.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-24"><span class="verse-num">2:24</span> <span class="verse-body">After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-25"><span class="verse-num">2:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to him: I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda, that will resolve the question to the king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-26"><span class="verse-num">2:26</span> <span class="verse-body">The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and the interpretation thereof?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-27"><span class="verse-num">2:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel made answer before the king, and said: The secret that the king desireth to know, none of the wise men, or the philosophers, or the diviners, or the soothsayers, can declare to the king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-28"><span class="verse-num">2:28</span> <span class="verse-body">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath shewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-29"><span class="verse-num">2:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall come to pass.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-30"><span class="verse-num">2:30</span> <span class="verse-body">To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive: but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thought of thy mind.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-31"><span class="verse-num">2:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was terrible.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-32"><span class="verse-num">2:32</span> <span class="verse-body">The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-33"><span class="verse-num">2:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-34"><span class="verse-num">2:34</span> <span class="verse-body">Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-35"><span class="verse-num">2:35</span> <span class="verse-body">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer's threshing floor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: but the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-36"><span class="verse-num">2:36</span> <span class="verse-body">This is the dream: we will also tell the interpretation thereof before thee, O king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-37"><span class="verse-num">2:37</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou art a king of kings: and the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, and strength, and power, and glory:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-38"><span class="verse-num">2:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And all places wherein the children of men, and the beasts of the field do dwell: he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand, and hath put all things under thy power: thou, therefore, art the head of gold.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-39"><span class="verse-num">2:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And after thee shall rise up another kingdom, inferior to thee, of silver: and another third kingdom of brass, which shall rule over all the world.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-40"><span class="verse-num">2:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron. As iron breaketh into pieces, and subdueth all things, so shall that break, and destroy all these.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-41"><span class="verse-num">2:41</span> <span class="verse-body">And whereas thou sawest the feet, and the toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron: the kingdom shall be divided, but yet it shall take its origin from the iron, according as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-42"><span class="verse-num">2:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay: the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-43"><span class="verse-num">2:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall be mingled indeed together with the seed of man, but they shall not stick fast one to another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-44"><span class="verse-num">2:44</span> <span class="verse-body">But in the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never by destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people: and it shall break in pieces, and shall consume all these kingdoms: and itself shall stand for ever.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-45"><span class="verse-num">2:45</span> <span class="verse-body">According as thou sawest, that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and broke in pieces the clay and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God hath shewn the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof is faithful.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-46"><span class="verse-num">2:46</span> <span class="verse-body">Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and incense.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-47"><span class="verse-num">2:47</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king spoke to Daniel, and said: Verily, your God is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of hidden things: seeing thou couldst discover this secret.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-2-48"><span class="verse-num">2:48</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station, and gave him many and great gifts: and he made him governor over all the provinces of Babylon: and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of Babylon.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-4-7"><span class="verse-num">4:7</span> <span class="verse-body">This was the vision of my head in my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was exceeding great.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-8"><span class="verse-num">4:8</span> <span class="verse-body">The tree was great and strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven: the sight thereof was even to the ends of all the earth.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-4-10"><span class="verse-num">4:10</span> <span class="verse-body">I saw in the vision of my head upon my bed, and behold a watcher, and a holy one came down from heaven.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-11"><span class="verse-num">4:11</span> <span class="verse-body">He cried aloud, and said thus: Cut down the tree, and chop off the branches thereof: shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruits: let the beasts fly away that are under it, and the birds from its branches.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-12"><span class="verse-num">4:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Nevertheless, leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be tied with a band of iron and of brass, among the grass, that is without, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-13"><span class="verse-num">4:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given him: and let seven times pass over him.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-4-15"><span class="verse-num">4:15</span> <span class="verse-body">I, king Nabuchodonosor, saw this dream: thou, therefore, O Baltassar, tell me quickly the interpretation: for all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to declare the meaning of it to me: but thou art able, because the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-16"><span class="verse-num">4:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Daniel, whose name was Baltassar, began silently to think within himself for about one hour: and his thought troubled him. But the king answering, said: Baltassar, let not the dream and the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Baltassar answered, and said: My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thy enemies.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-17"><span class="verse-num">4:17</span> <span class="verse-body">The tree which thou sawest, which was high and strong, whose height reached to the skies, and the sight thereof into all the earth:</span></p>

<p id="daniel-4-21"><span class="verse-num">4:21</span> <span class="verse-body">This is the interpretation of the sentence of the most High, which is come upon my lord, the king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-22"><span class="verse-num">4:22</span> <span class="verse-body">They shall cast thee out from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle, and with wild beasts, and thou shalt eat grass, as an ox, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven: and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-23"><span class="verse-num">4:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But whereas he commanded, that the stump of the roots thereof, that is, of the tree, should be left: thy kingdom shall remain to thee, after thou shalt have known that power is from heaven.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-24"><span class="verse-num">4:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and redeem thou thy sins with alms, and thy iniquities with works of mercy to the poor: perhaps he will forgive thy offences.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-25"><span class="verse-num">4:25</span> <span class="verse-body">All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-26"><span class="verse-num">4:26</span> <span class="verse-body">At the end of twelve months he was walking in the palace of Babylon.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-27"><span class="verse-num">4:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king answered, and said: Is not this the great Babylon, which I have built, to be the seat of the kingdom, by the strength of my power, and in the glory of my excellence?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-28"><span class="verse-num">4:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And while the word was yet in the king's mouth, a voice came down from heaven: To thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, it is said: Thy kingdom shall pass from thee.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-29"><span class="verse-num">4:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And they shall cast thee out from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and wild beasts: thou shalt eat grass like an ox, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-30"><span class="verse-num">4:30</span> <span class="verse-body">The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor, and he was driven away from among men, and did eat grass, like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: till his hairs grew like the feathers of eagles, and his nails like birds' claws.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-31"><span class="verse-num">4:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Now at the end of the days, I, Nabuchodonosor, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my sense was restored to me: and I blessed the most High, and I praised and glorified him that liveth for ever: for his power is an everlasting power, and his kingdom is to all generations.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-32"><span class="verse-num">4:32</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him: for he doth according to his will, as well with the powers of heaven, as among the inhabitants of the earth: and there is none that can resist his hand, and say to him: Why hast thou done it?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-33"><span class="verse-num">4:33</span> <span class="verse-body">At the same time my sense returned to me, and I came to the honour and glory of my kingdom: and my shape returned to me: and my nobles, and my magistrates, sought for me, and I was restored to my kingdom: and greater majesty was added to me.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-4-34"><span class="verse-num">4:34</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore I, Nabuchodonosor, do now praise, and magnify, and glorify the King of heaven: because all his works are true, and his ways judgments, and them that walk in pride he is able to abase.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-6-10"><span class="verse-num">6:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Now, when Daniel knew this, that is to say, that the law was made, he went into his house: and opening the windows in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem, he knelt down three times a day, and adored and gave thanks before his God, as he had been accustomed to do before.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-11"><span class="verse-num">6:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore those men carefully watching him, found Daniel praying and making supplication to his God.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-12"><span class="verse-num">6:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And they came and spoke to the king concerning the edict: O king, hast thou not decreed, that every man that should make a request to any of the gods, or men, for thirty days, but to thyself, O king, should be cast into the den of the lions? And the king answered them, saying: The word is true, according to the decree of the Medes and Persians, which it is not lawful to violate.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-13"><span class="verse-num">6:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Then they answered, and said before the king: Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Juda, hath not regarded thy law, nor the decree that thou hast made: but three times a day he maketh his prayer.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-14"><span class="verse-num">6:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when the king had heard these words, he was very much grieved, and in behalf of Daniel he set his heart to deliver him, and even till sunset he laboured to save him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-15"><span class="verse-num">6:15</span> <span class="verse-body">But those men perceiving the king's design, said to him: Know thou, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree which the king hath made, may be altered.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-16"><span class="verse-num">6:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of the lions. And the king said to Daniel: Thy God, whom thou always servest, he will deliver thee.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-17"><span class="verse-num">6:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den: which the king sealed with his own ring, and with the ring of his nobles, that nothing should be done against Daniel.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-18"><span class="verse-num">6:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king went away to his house, and laid himself down without taking supper, and meat was not set before him, and even sleep departed from him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-19"><span class="verse-num">6:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the king rising very early in the morning, went in haste to the lions' den:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-20"><span class="verse-num">6:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And coming near to the den, cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel, and said to him: Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou servest always, been able, thinkest thou, to deliver thee from the lions?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-21"><span class="verse-num">6:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel answering the king, said: O king, live for ever:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-22"><span class="verse-num">6:22</span> <span class="verse-body">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him justice hath been found in me: yea, and before thee, O king, I have done no offence.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-23"><span class="verse-num">6:23</span> <span class="verse-body">Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and he commanded that Daniel should be taken out of the den: and Daniel was taken out of the den, and no hurt was found in him, because he believed in his God.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-24"><span class="verse-num">6:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And by the king's commandment, those men were brought that had accused Daniel: and they were cast into the lions' den, they and their children, and their wives: and they did not reach the bottom of the den, before the lions caught them, and broke all their bones in pieces.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-25"><span class="verse-num">6:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Then king Darius wrote to all people, tribes, and languages, dwelling in the whole earth: PEACE be multiplied unto you.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-26"><span class="verse-num">6:26</span> <span class="verse-body">It is decreed by me, that in all my empire and my kingdom, all men dread and fear the God of Daniel. For he is the living and eternal God for ever: and his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his power shall be for ever.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-27"><span class="verse-num">6:27</span> <span class="verse-body">He is the deliverer, and saviour, doing signs and wonders in heaven, and in earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions' den.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-6-28"><span class="verse-num">6:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Now Daniel continued unto the reign of Darius, and the reign of Cyrus, the Persian.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-7-1"><span class="verse-num">7:1</span> <span class="verse-body">In the first year of Baltasar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream: and the vision of his head was upon his bed: and writing the dream, he comprehended it in a few words: and relating the sum of it in short, he said:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-2"><span class="verse-num">7:2</span> <span class="verse-body">I saw in my vision by night, and behold the four winds of the heavens strove upon the great sea.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-3"><span class="verse-num">7:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And four great beasts, different one from another, came up out of the sea.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-4"><span class="verse-num">7:4</span> <span class="verse-body">The first was like a lioness, and had the wings of an eagle: I beheld till her wings were plucked off, and she was lifted up from the earth, and stood upon her feet as a man, and the heart of a man was given to her.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-5"><span class="verse-num">7:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And behold another beast, like a bear, stood up on one side: and there were three rows in the mouth thereof, and in the teeth thereof, and thus they said to it: Arise, devour much flesh.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-6"><span class="verse-num">7:6</span> <span class="verse-body">After this I beheld, and lo, another like a leopard, and it had upon it four wings, as of a fowl, and the beast had four heads, and power was given to it.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-7"><span class="verse-num">7:7</span> <span class="verse-body">After this I beheld in the vision of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, terrible and wonderful, and exceeding strong, it had great iron teeth, eating and breaking in pieces, and treading down the rest with his feet: and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen before it, and had ten horns.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-8"><span class="verse-num">7:8</span> <span class="verse-body">I considered the horns, and behold another little horn sprung out of the midst of them: and three of the first horns were plucked up at the presence thereof: and behold eyes like the eyes of a man were in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-9"><span class="verse-num">7:9</span> <span class="verse-body">I beheld till thrones were placed, and the ancient of days sat: his garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like clean wool: his throne like flames of fire: the wheels of it like a burning fire.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-10"><span class="verse-num">7:10</span> <span class="verse-body">A swift stream of fire issued forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before him: the judgment sat, and the books were opened.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-11"><span class="verse-num">7:11</span> <span class="verse-body">I beheld, because of the voice of the great words which that horn spoke: and I saw that the beast was slain, and the body thereof was destroyed, and given to the fire to be burnt:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-12"><span class="verse-num">7:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And that the power of the other beasts was taken away: and that times of life were appointed them for a time, and a time.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-13"><span class="verse-num">7:13</span> <span class="verse-body">I beheld, therefore, in the vision of the night, and lo, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and he came even to the ancient of days: and they presented him before him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-14"><span class="verse-num">7:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And he gave him power, and glory, and a kingdom: and all peoples, tribes, and tongues shall serve him: his power is an everlasting power that shall not be taken away: and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-15"><span class="verse-num">7:15</span> <span class="verse-body">My spirit trembled; I, Daniel, was affrighted at these things, and the visions of my head troubled me.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-16"><span class="verse-num">7:16</span> <span class="verse-body">I went near to one of them that stood by, and asked the truth of him concerning all these things, and he told me the interpretation of the words, and instructed me:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-17"><span class="verse-num">7:17</span> <span class="verse-body">These four great beasts, are four kingdoms, which shall arise out of the earth.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-18"><span class="verse-num">7:18</span> <span class="verse-body">But the saints of the most high God shall take the kingdom: and they shall possess the kingdom for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-19"><span class="verse-num">7:19</span> <span class="verse-body">After this I would diligently learn concerning the fourth beast, which was very different from all, and exceeding terrible: his teeth and claws were of iron: he devoured and broke in pieces, and the rest he stamped upon with his feet:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-20"><span class="verse-num">7:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And concerning the ten horns that he had on his head: and concerning the other that came up, before which three horns fell: and of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and was greater than the rest.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-21"><span class="verse-num">7:21</span> <span class="verse-body">I beheld, and lo, that horn made war against the saints, and prevailed over them,</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-22"><span class="verse-num">7:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Till the ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most High, and the time came, and the saints obtained the kingdom.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-23"><span class="verse-num">7:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And thus he said: The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be greater than all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-24"><span class="verse-num">7:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And the ten horns of the same kingdom, shall be ten kings: and another shall rise up after them, and he shall be mightier than the former, and he shall bring down three kings.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-25"><span class="verse-num">7:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And he shall speak words against the High One, and shall crush the saints of the most High: and he shall think himself able to change times and laws, and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time, and times, and half a time.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-26"><span class="verse-num">7:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And a judgment shall sit, that his power may be taken away, and be broken in pieces, and perish even to the end.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-27"><span class="verse-num">7:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And that the kingdom, and power, and the greatness of the kingdom, under the whole heaven, may be given to the people of the saints of the most High: whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all kings shall serve him, and shall obey him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-7-28"><span class="verse-num">7:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Hitherto is the end of the word. I, Daniel, was much troubled with my thoughts, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the word in my heart.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-8-2"><span class="verse-num">8:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-8-3"><span class="verse-num">8:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up. Afterward</span></p>
<p id="daniel-8-4"><span class="verse-num">8:4</span> <span class="verse-body">I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-8-5"><span class="verse-num">8:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And I understood: and behold a he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he touched not the ground, and the he-goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-8-6"><span class="verse-num">8:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-8-8"><span class="verse-num">8:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And the he-goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-8-13"><span class="verse-num">8:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another I know not to whom, that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-8-14"><span class="verse-num">8:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-13-1"><span class="verse-num">13:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Now there was a man that dwelt in Babylon, and his name was Joakim:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-2"><span class="verse-num">13:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Helcias, a very beautiful woman, and one that feared God.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-3"><span class="verse-num">13:3</span> <span class="verse-body">For her parents being just, had instructed their daughter according to the law of Moses.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-4"><span class="verse-num">13:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Now Joakim was very rich, and had an orchard near his house: and the Jews resorted to him, because he was the most honourable of them all.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-5"><span class="verse-num">13:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And there were two of the ancients of the people appointed judges that year, of whom the Lord said: That iniquity came out from Babylon, from the ancient judges, that seemed to govern the people.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-6"><span class="verse-num">13:6</span> <span class="verse-body">These men frequented the house of Joakim, and all that hand any matters of judgment came to them.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-7"><span class="verse-num">13:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went in, and walked in her husband's orchard.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-8"><span class="verse-num">13:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And the old men saw her going in every day, and walking: and they were inflamed with lust towards her:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-9"><span class="verse-num">13:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-10"><span class="verse-num">13:10</span> <span class="verse-body">So they were both wounded with the love of her, yet they did not make known their grief one to the other.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-11"><span class="verse-num">13:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For they were ashamed to declare to one another their lust, being desirous to have to do with her:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-12"><span class="verse-num">13:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And they watched carefully every day to see her. And one said to the other:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-13"><span class="verse-num">13:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us now go home, for it is dinner time. So going out, they departed one from another.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-14"><span class="verse-num">13:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And turning back again, they came both to the same place: and asking one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust: and then they agreed together upon a time, when they might find her alone.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-15"><span class="verse-num">13:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And it fell out, as they watched a fit day, she went in on a time, as yesterday and the day before, with two maids only, and was desirous to wash herself in the orchard: for it was hot weather.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-16"><span class="verse-num">13:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And there was nobody there, but the two old men that had hid themselves, and were beholding her.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-17"><span class="verse-num">13:17</span> <span class="verse-body">So she said to the maids: Bring me oil, and washing balls, and shut the doors of the orchard, that I may wash me.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-18"><span class="verse-num">13:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And they did as she bade them: and they shut the doors of the orchard, and went out by a back door to fetch what she had commanded them, and they knew not that the elders were hid within.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-19"><span class="verse-num">13:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders arose, and ran to her, and said:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-20"><span class="verse-num">13:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Behold the doors of the orchard are shut, and nobody seeth us, and we are in love with thee: wherefore consent to us, and lie with us.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-21"><span class="verse-num">13:21</span> <span class="verse-body">But if thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee, and therefore thou didst send away thy maids form thee.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-22"><span class="verse-num">13:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Susanna sighed, and said: I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is death to me: and if I do it not, I shall not escape your hands.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-23"><span class="verse-num">13:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But it is better for me to fall into your hands without doing it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-24"><span class="verse-num">13:24</span> <span class="verse-body">With that Susanna cried out with a loud voice: and the elders also cried out against her.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-25"><span class="verse-num">13:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And one of them ran to the door of the orchard, and opened it.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-26"><span class="verse-num">13:26</span> <span class="verse-body">So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the orchard, they rushed in by the back door, to see what was the matter.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-27"><span class="verse-num">13:27</span> <span class="verse-body">But after the old men had spoken, the servants were greatly ashamed: for never had there been any such word said of Susanna. And on the next day,</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-28"><span class="verse-num">13:28</span> <span class="verse-body">When the people were come to Joakim, her husband, the two elders also came full of wicked device against Susanna, to put her to death.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-29"><span class="verse-num">13:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And they said before the people: Send to Susanna, daughter of Helcias, the wife of Joakim. And presently they sent.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-30"><span class="verse-num">13:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And she came with her parents, and children and all her kindred.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-31"><span class="verse-num">13:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Now Susanna was exceeding delicate, and beautiful to behold.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-32"><span class="verse-num">13:32</span> <span class="verse-body">But those wicked men commanded that her face should be uncovered, (for she was covered) that so at least they might be satisfied with her beauty.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-33"><span class="verse-num">13:33</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore her friends, and all her acquaintance wept.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-34"><span class="verse-num">13:34</span> <span class="verse-body">But the two elders rising up in the midst of the people, laid their hands upon her head.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-35"><span class="verse-num">13:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And she weeping, looked up to heaven, for her heart had confidence in the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-36"><span class="verse-num">13:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And the elders said: As we walked in the orchard alone, this woman came in with two maids, and shut the doors of the orchard, ans sent away the maids from her.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-37"><span class="verse-num">13:37</span> <span class="verse-body">Then a young man that was there hid came to her, and lay with her.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-38"><span class="verse-num">13:38</span> <span class="verse-body">But we that were in a corner of the orchard, seeing this wickedness, ran up to them, and we saw them lie together.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-39"><span class="verse-num">13:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And him indeed we could not take, because he was stronger than us, and opening the doors, he leaped out:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-40"><span class="verse-num">13:40</span> <span class="verse-body">But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: of this thing we are witnesses.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-41"><span class="verse-num">13:41</span> <span class="verse-body">The multitude believed them, as being the elders, and the judges of the people, and they condemned her to death.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-42"><span class="verse-num">13:42</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said: O eternal God, who knowest hidden things, who knowest all things before they come to pass,</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-43"><span class="verse-num">13:43</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me: and behold I must die, whereas I have done none of these things, which these men have maliciously forged against me.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-44"><span class="verse-num">13:44</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord heard her voice.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-45"><span class="verse-num">13:45</span> <span class="verse-body">And when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young boy, whose name was Daniel:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-46"><span class="verse-num">13:46</span> <span class="verse-body">And he cried out with a loud voice: I am clear from the blood of this woman.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-47"><span class="verse-num">13:47</span> <span class="verse-body">Then all the people turning themselves towards him, said: What meaneth this word that thou hast spoken?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-48"><span class="verse-num">13:48</span> <span class="verse-body">But he standing in the midst of them, said: Are ye so foolish, ye children of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth, you have condemned a daughter of Israel?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-49"><span class="verse-num">13:49</span> <span class="verse-body">Return to judgment, for they have borne false witness against her.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-50"><span class="verse-num">13:50</span> <span class="verse-body">So all the people turned again in haste, and the old men said to him: Come, and sit thou down among us, and shew it us: seeing God hath given thee the honour of old age.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-51"><span class="verse-num">13:51</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel said to the people: Separate these two far from one another, and I will examine them.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-52"><span class="verse-num">13:52</span> <span class="verse-body">So when they were put asunder one from the other, he called one of them, and said to him: O thou that art grown old in evil days, now are thy sins come out, which thou hast committed before:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-53"><span class="verse-num">13:53</span> <span class="verse-body">In judging unjust judgments, oppressing the innocent, and letting the guilty to go free, whereas the Lord saith: The innocent and the just thou shalt not kill.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-54"><span class="verse-num">13:54</span> <span class="verse-body">Now then if thou sawest her, tell me under what tree thou sawest them conversing together: He said: Under a mastic tree.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-55"><span class="verse-num">13:55</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel said: Well hast thou lied against thy own head: for behold the angel of God having received the sentence of him, shall cut thee in two.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-56"><span class="verse-num">13:56</span> <span class="verse-body">And having put him aside, he commanded that the other should come, and he said to him: O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived tee, and lust hath perverted thy heart:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-57"><span class="verse-num">13:57</span> <span class="verse-body">Thus did you do to the daughters of Israel, and they for fear conversed with you: but a daughter of Juda would not abide your wickedness.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-58"><span class="verse-num">13:58</span> <span class="verse-body">Now, therefore, tell me, under what tree didst thou take them conversing together. And he answered: Under a holm tree.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-59"><span class="verse-num">13:59</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel said to him: Well hast thou also lied against thy own head: for the angel of the Lord waiteth with a sword to cut thee in two, and to destroy you.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-60"><span class="verse-num">13:60</span> <span class="verse-body">With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and they blessed God, who saveth them that trust in him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-61"><span class="verse-num">13:61</span> <span class="verse-body">And they rose up against the two elders, (for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their own mouth) and they did to them as they had maliciously dealt against their neighbour,</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-62"><span class="verse-num">13:62</span> <span class="verse-body">To fulfil the law of Moses: and they put them to death, and innocent blood was saved in that day.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-63"><span class="verse-num">13:63</span> <span class="verse-body">But Helcias, and his wife, praised God, for their daughter, Susanna, with Joakim, her husband, and all her kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-64"><span class="verse-num">13:64</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel became great in the sight of the people from that day, and thence forward.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-13-65"><span class="verse-num">13:65</span> <span class="verse-body">And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers; and Cyrus, the Persian, received his kingdom.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-14-1"><span class="verse-num">14:1</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel was the king's guest, and was honoured above all his friends.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-2"><span class="verse-num">14:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel: and there was spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-3"><span class="verse-num">14:3</span> <span class="verse-body">The king also worshipped him, and went every day to adore him: but Daniel adored his God. And the king said to him: Why dost thou not adore Bel?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-4"><span class="verse-num">14:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And he answered, and said to him: Because I do not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, that created heaven and earth, and hath power over all flesh.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-5"><span class="verse-num">14:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said to him: Doth not Bel seem to thee to be a living god? Seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-6"><span class="verse-num">14:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Daniel smiled, and said: O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, neither hath he eaten at any time.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-7"><span class="verse-num">14:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king being angry, called for his priests, and said to them: If you tell me not who it is that eateth up these expenses, you shall die.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-8"><span class="verse-num">14:8</span> <span class="verse-body">But if you can shew that Bel eateth these things, Daniel shall die, because he hath blasphemed against Bel. And Daniel said to the king: Be it done according to thy word.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-9"><span class="verse-num">14:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the priests of Bel were seventy, beside their wives, and little ones, and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-10"><span class="verse-num">14:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And the priests of Bel said: Behold, we go out: and do thou, O king, set on the meats, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast, and seal it with thy own ring:</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-11"><span class="verse-num">14:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And when thou comest in the morning, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death, or else Daniel, that hath lied against us.</span></p>

<p id="daniel-14-13"><span class="verse-num">14:13</span> <span class="verse-body">So it came to pass after they were gone out, the king set the meats before Bel: and Daniel commanded his servants, and they brought ashes, and he sifted them all over the temple before the king: and going forth, they shut the door, and having sealed it with the king's ring, they departed.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-14"><span class="verse-num">14:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But the priests went in by night, according to their custom, with their wives, and their children: and they eat and drank up all.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-15"><span class="verse-num">14:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king arose early in the morning, and Daniel with him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-16"><span class="verse-num">14:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said: Are the seals whole, Daniel? And he answered: They are whole, O king.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-17"><span class="verse-num">14:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried out with a loud voice: Great art thou, O Bel, and there is not any deceit with thee.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-18"><span class="verse-num">14:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel laughed: and he held the king, that he should not go in: and he said: Behold the pavement, mark whose footsteps these are.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-19"><span class="verse-num">14:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said: I see the footsteps of men, and women, and children. And the king was angry.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-20"><span class="verse-num">14:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Then he took the priests, and their wives, and their children: and they shewed him the private doors by which they came in, and consumed the things that were on the table.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-21"><span class="verse-num">14:21</span> <span class="verse-body">The king, therefore, put them to death, and delivered Bel into the power of Daniel: who destroyed him and his temple.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-22"><span class="verse-num">14:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And there was a great dragon in that place, and the Babylonians worshipped him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-23"><span class="verse-num">14:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said to Daniel: Behold, thou canst not say now, that this is not a living god: adore him, therefore.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-24"><span class="verse-num">14:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel said: I adore the Lord, my God: for he is the living God: but that is no living god.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-25"><span class="verse-num">14:25</span> <span class="verse-body">But give me leave, O king, and I will kill this dragon without sword or club. And the king said, I give thee leave.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-26"><span class="verse-num">14:26</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and boiled them together: and he made lumps, and put them into the dragon's mouth, and the dragon burst asunder. And he said: Behold him whom you worship.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-27"><span class="verse-num">14:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the Babylonians had heard this, they took great indignation: and being gathered together against the king, they said: The king is become a Jew. He hath destroyed Bel, he hath killed the dragon, and he hath put the priests to death.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-28"><span class="verse-num">14:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And they came to the king, and said: Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thy house.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-29"><span class="verse-num">14:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king saw that they pressed upon him violently: and being constrained by necessity: he delivered Daniel to them.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-30"><span class="verse-num">14:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And they cast him into the den of lions, and he was there six days.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-31"><span class="verse-num">14:31</span> <span class="verse-body">And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given to them two carcasses every day, and two sheep: but then they were not given unto them, that they might devour Daniel.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-32"><span class="verse-num">14:32</span> <span class="verse-body">Now there was in Judea a prophet called Habacuc, and he had boiled pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl: and was going into the field, to carry it to the reapers.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-33"><span class="verse-num">14:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And the angel of the Lord said to Habacuc: Carry the dinner which thou hast into Babylon, to Daniel, who is in the lions' den.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-34"><span class="verse-num">14:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And Habacuc said: Lord, I never saw Babylon, nor do I know the den.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-35"><span class="verse-num">14:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And the angel of the Lord took him by the top of his head, and carried him by the hair of his head, and set him in Babylon, over the den, in the force of his spirit.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-36"><span class="verse-num">14:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And Habacuc cried, saying: O Daniel, thou servant of God, take the dinner that God hath sent thee.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-37"><span class="verse-num">14:37</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God, and thou hast not forsaken them that love thee.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-38"><span class="verse-num">14:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And Daniel arose, and eat. And the angel of the Lord presently set Habacuc again in his own place.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-39"><span class="verse-num">14:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And upon the seventh day the king came to bewail Daniel: and he came to the den, and looked in, and behold Daniel was sitting in the midst of the lions.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-40"><span class="verse-num">14:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king cried out with a loud voice, saying: Great art thou, O Lord, the God of Daniel. And he drew him out of the lions' den.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-41"><span class="verse-num">14:41</span> <span class="verse-body">But those that had been the cause of his destruction, he cast into the den, and they were devoured in a moment before him.</span></p>
<p id="daniel-14-42"><span class="verse-num">14:42</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the king said: Let all the inhabitants of the whole earth fear the God of Daniel: for he is the Saviour, working signs, and wonders in the earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions' den.</span></p>
