<p id="1-peter-3-1"><span class="verse-num">3:1</span> <span class="verse-body">In like manner also, let wives be subject to their husbands: that, if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives,</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-2"><span class="verse-num">3:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Considering your chaste conversation with fear.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-3"><span class="verse-num">3:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-4"><span class="verse-num">3:4</span> <span class="verse-body">But the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of God.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-5"><span class="verse-num">3:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For after this manner heretofore, the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-6"><span class="verse-num">3:6</span> <span class="verse-body">As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well and not fearing any disturbance.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-7"><span class="verse-num">3:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-8"><span class="verse-num">3:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-9"><span class="verse-num">3:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-10"><span class="verse-num">3:10</span> <span class="verse-body">For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-11"><span class="verse-num">3:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Let him decline from evil and do good: Let him seek after peace and pursue it:</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-12"><span class="verse-num">3:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-13"><span class="verse-num">3:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-14"><span class="verse-num">3:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But if also you suffer any thing for justice' sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear: and be not troubled.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-15"><span class="verse-num">3:15</span> <span class="verse-body">But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-16"><span class="verse-num">3:16</span> <span class="verse-body">But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-17"><span class="verse-num">3:17</span> <span class="verse-body">For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer than doing ill.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-18"><span class="verse-num">3:18</span> <span class="verse-body">Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-19"><span class="verse-num">3:19</span> <span class="verse-body">In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-20"><span class="verse-num">3:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-21"><span class="verse-num">3:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but, the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p id="1-peter-3-22"><span class="verse-num">3:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him.</span></p>
