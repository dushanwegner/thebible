<p id="1-machabees-3-37"><span class="verse-num">3:37</span> <span class="verse-body">So the king took the half of the army that remained, and went forth from Antioch, the chief city of his kingdom, in the hundred and forty-seventh year: and he passed over the river Euphrates, and went through the higher countries.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-3-38"><span class="verse-num">3:38</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Lysias chose Ptolemee, the son of Dorymenus, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king's friends.</span></p>

<p id="1-machabees-3-45"><span class="verse-num">3:45</span> <span class="verse-body">Now Jerusalem was not inhabited, but was like a desert: there was none of her children that went in or out: and the sanctuary was trodden down: and the children of strangers were in the castle, there was the habitation of the Gentiles: and joy was taken away from Jacob, and the pipe and harp ceased there.</span></p>

<p id="1-machabees-3-56"><span class="verse-num">3:56</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to them that were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, that they should return every man to his house, according to the law.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-3-57"><span class="verse-num">3:57</span> <span class="verse-body">So they removed the camp, and pitched on the south side of Emmaus.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-3-58"><span class="verse-num">3:58</span> <span class="verse-body">And Judas said: Gird yourselves, and be valiant men, and be ready against the morning, that you may fight with these nations that are assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-3-59"><span class="verse-num">3:59</span> <span class="verse-body">For it is better for us to die in battle, than to see the evils of our nation, and of the holies:</span></p>

<p id="1-machabees-6-7"><span class="verse-num">6:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And that they had thrown down the abomination which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls as before, and Bethsura also, his city.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-6-8"><span class="verse-num">6:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass, when the king heard these words, that he was struck with fear, and exceedingly moved: and he laid himself down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not fallen out to him as he imagined.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-6-9"><span class="verse-num">6:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And he remained there many days: for great grief came more and more upon him, and he made account that he should die.</span></p>

<p id="1-machabees-6-13"><span class="verse-num">6:13</span> <span class="verse-body">I know, therefore, that for this cause these evils have found me: and behold I perish with great grief in a strange land.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-6-14"><span class="verse-num">6:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Then he called Philip, one of his friends, and he made him regent over all his kingdom.</span></p>

<p id="1-machabees-6-52"><span class="verse-num">6:52</span> <span class="verse-body">And they also made engines against their engines, and they fought for many days.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-6-53"><span class="verse-num">6:53</span> <span class="verse-body">But there were no victuals in the city, because it was the seventh year: and such as had stayed in Judea of them that came from among the nations, had eaten the residue of all that which had been stored up.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-6-54"><span class="verse-num">6:54</span> <span class="verse-body">And there remained in the holy places but a few, for the famine had prevailed over them: and they were dispersed every man to his own place.</span></p>

<p id="1-machabees-6-60"><span class="verse-num">6:60</span> <span class="verse-body">And the proposal was acceptable in the sight of the king, and of the princes: and he sent to them to make peace: and they accepted of it.</span></p>

<p id="1-machabees-10-74"><span class="verse-num">10:74</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind: and he chose ten thousand men, and went out of Jerusalem, and Simon, his brother, met him to help him.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-75"><span class="verse-num">10:75</span> <span class="verse-body">And they pitched their tents near Joppe, but they shut him out of the city: because a garrison of Apollonius was in Joppe, and he laid siege to it.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-76"><span class="verse-num">10:76</span> <span class="verse-body">And they that were in the city being affrighted, opened the gates to him: so Jonathan took Joppe.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-77"><span class="verse-num">10:77</span> <span class="verse-body">And Apollonius heard of it, and he took three thousand horsemen, and a great army.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-78"><span class="verse-num">10:78</span> <span class="verse-body">And he went to Azotus, as one that was making a journey, and immediately he went forth into the plain: because he had a great number of horsemen, and he trusted in them.

<p id="1-machabees-10-79"><span class="verse-num">10:79</span> <span class="verse-body">And Apollonius left privately in the camp a thousand horsemen behind them.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-80"><span class="verse-num">10:80</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jonathan knew that there was an ambush behind him, and they surrounded his army, and cast darts at the people from morning till evening.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-81"><span class="verse-num">10:81</span> <span class="verse-body">But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so their horses were fatigued.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-82"><span class="verse-num">10:82</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Simon drew forth his army, and attacked the legion: for the horsemen were wearied: and they were discomfited by him, and fled.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-83"><span class="verse-num">10:83</span> <span class="verse-body">And they that were scattered about the plain fled into Azotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, there to save themselves.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-84"><span class="verse-num">10:84</span> <span class="verse-body">But Jonathan set fire to Azotus, and the cities that were round about it, and took the spoils of them and the temple of Dagon: and all them that were fled into it, he burnt with fire.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-85"><span class="verse-num">10:85</span> <span class="verse-body">So they that were slain by the sword, with them that were burnt, were almost eight thousand men.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-86"><span class="verse-num">10:86</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jonathan, removed his army from thence and camped against Ascalon: and they went out of the city to meet him with great honour.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-87"><span class="verse-num">10:87</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with his people, having many spoils.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-88"><span class="verse-num">10:88</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass, when Alexander, the king heard these words, that he honoured Jonathan yet more.</span></p>
<p id="1-machabees-10-89"><span class="verse-num">10:89</span> <span class="verse-body">And he sent him a buckle of gold, as the custom is, to be given to such as are of the royal blood. And he gave him Accaron, and all the borders thereof, in possession.</span></p>
