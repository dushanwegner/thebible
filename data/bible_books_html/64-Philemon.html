<p id="philemon-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer,</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus and towards all the saints:</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work that is in you in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus to command thee that which is to the purpose:</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee but now is profitable both to me and thee:</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee that thou mightest receive him again for ever:</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me. But how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And if he hath wronged thee in any thing or is in thy debt, put that to my account.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee that thou owest me thy own self also.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord! Refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus:</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow labourers.</span></p>
<p id="philemon-1-25"><span class="verse-num">1:25</span> <span class="verse-body">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span></p>
