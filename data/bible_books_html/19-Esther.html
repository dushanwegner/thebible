<p id="esther-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty seven provinces:</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers vessels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a king's magnificence.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding beautiful.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">But she refused, and would not come at the king's commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Asked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">(Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him:)</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the king's indignation is just.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan.</span></p>
<p id="esther-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people.</span></p>

<p id="esther-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remembered Vasthi, and what she had done and what she had suffered:</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king's servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought for the king, virgins and beautiful,</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is the overseer and keeper of the king's women: and let them receive women's ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And whosoever among them all shall please the king's eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And he had brought up his brother's daughter Edissa, who by another name was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the king's ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women's ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king's house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins were kept, having a care for Esther's welfare, and desiring to know what would befall her.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when every virgin's turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the king's chamber.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the king's concubines: neither could she return any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her by name to come.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women's ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther, And he gave rest to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai stayed at the king's gate,</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king's gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the king's eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen Esther: and she to the king in Mardochai's name, who had reported the thing unto her.</span></p>
<p id="esther-2-23"><span class="verse-num">2:23</span> <span class="verse-body">It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet. And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chronicles before the king.</span></p>
<h2 id="esther-ch-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="verses"><a href="#esther-3-1">1</a> <a href="#esther-3-2">2</a> <a href="#esther-3-3">3</a> <a href="#esther-3-4">4</a> <a href="#esther-3-5">5</a> <a href="#esther-3-6">6</a> <a href="#esther-3-7">7</a> <a href="#esther-3-8">8</a> <a href="#esther-3-9">9</a> <a href="#esther-3-10">10</a> <a href="#esther-3-11">11</a> <a href="#esther-3-12">12</a> <a href="#esther-3-13">13</a> <a href="#esther-3-14">14</a> <a href="#esther-3-15">15</a></p>
<p id="esther-3-1"><span class="verse-num">3:1</span> <span class="verse-body">After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-2"><span class="verse-num">3:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the king's servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-3"><span class="verse-num">3:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king's servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king's commandment?</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-4"><span class="verse-num">3:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-5"><span class="verse-num">3:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-6"><span class="verse-num">3:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-7"><span class="verse-num">3:7</span> <span class="verse-body">In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-8"><span class="verse-num">3:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the king's ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-9"><span class="verse-num">3:9</span> <span class="verse-body">If it please thee, decree that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-10"><span class="verse-num">3:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-11"><span class="verse-num">3:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-12"><span class="verse-num">3:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king's scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same mouth: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king's lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-13"><span class="verse-num">3:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Were sent by the king's messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-14"><span class="verse-num">3:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.</span></p>
<p id="esther-3-15"><span class="verse-num">3:15</span> <span class="verse-body">The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the king's commandment. And immediately the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the Jews that were in the city weeping.</span></p>
<h2 id="esther-ch-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="verses"><a href="#esther-4-1">1</a> <a href="#esther-4-2">2</a> <a href="#esther-4-3">3</a> <a href="#esther-4-4">4</a> <a href="#esther-4-5">5</a> <a href="#esther-4-6">6</a> <a href="#esther-4-7">7</a> <a href="#esther-4-8">8</a> <a href="#esther-4-9">9</a> <a href="#esther-4-10">10</a> <a href="#esther-4-11">11</a> <a href="#esther-4-12">12</a> <a href="#esther-4-13">13</a> <a href="#esther-4-14">14</a> <a href="#esther-4-15">15</a> <a href="#esther-4-16">16</a> <a href="#esther-4-17">17</a></p>
<p id="esther-4-1"><span class="verse-num">4:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, strewing ashes on his head and he cried with a loud voice in the street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish of his mind.</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-2"><span class="verse-num">4:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king's court.</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-3"><span class="verse-num">4:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king's cruel edict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-4"><span class="verse-num">4:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Esther's maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-5"><span class="verse-num">4:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-6"><span class="verse-num">4:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-7"><span class="verse-num">4:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the king's treasures, to have the Jews destroyed.</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-8"><span class="verse-num">4:8</span> <span class="verse-body">He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to entreat him for her people.</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-9"><span class="verse-num">4:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-10"><span class="verse-num">4:10</span> <span class="verse-body">She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-11"><span class="verse-num">4:11</span> <span class="verse-body">All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king's inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-12"><span class="verse-num">4:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And when Mardochai had heard this,</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-13"><span class="verse-num">4:13</span> <span class="verse-body">He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king's house, more than all the Jews:</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-14"><span class="verse-num">4:14</span> <span class="verse-body">For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father's house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-15"><span class="verse-num">4:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:</span></p>
<p id="esther-4-16"><span class="verse-num">4:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.</span></p>

<p id="esther-5-1"><span class="verse-num">5:1</span> <span class="verse-body">And on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's hall: now he sat upon his throne in the hall of the palace, over against the door of the house.</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-2"><span class="verse-num">5:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand and she drew near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-3"><span class="verse-num">5:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said to her: What wilt thou, queen Esther?  what is thy request? if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom, it shall be given to thee.</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-4"><span class="verse-num">5:4</span> <span class="verse-body">But she answered: If it please the king, I beseech thee to come to me this day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared.</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-5"><span class="verse-num">5:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Esther's will. So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the queen had prepared for them.</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-6"><span class="verse-num">5:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest thou? although thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-7"><span class="verse-num">5:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And Esther answered: My petition and request is this:</span></p>

<p id="esther-5-9"><span class="verse-num">5:9</span> <span class="verse-body">So Aman went out that day joyful and merry.

<p id="esther-5-10"><span class="verse-num">5:10</span> <span class="verse-body">But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together to him his friends, and Zares his wife:</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-11"><span class="verse-num">5:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants.</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-12"><span class="verse-num">5:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And after this he said: Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet with the king, but me: and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king:</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-13"><span class="verse-num">5:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the king's gate.</span></p>
<p id="esther-5-14"><span class="verse-num">5:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared.</span></p>

<p id="esther-7-5"><span class="verse-num">7:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that he should do these things?</span></p>
<p id="esther-7-6"><span class="verse-num">7:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy. Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen.</span></p>

<p id="esther-8-8"><span class="verse-num">8:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you in the king's name, and seal the letters with my ring.

<p id="esther-8-9"><span class="verse-num">8:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the king's scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.</span></p>
<p id="esther-8-10"><span class="verse-num">8:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And these letters which were sent in the king's name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.</span></p>
<p id="esther-8-11"><span class="verse-num">8:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.</span></p>
<p id="esther-8-12"><span class="verse-num">8:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to wit, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.</span></p>
<p id="esther-8-13"><span class="verse-num">8:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies.</span></p>

<p id="esther-9-2"><span class="verse-num">9:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors.

<p id="esther-9-5"><span class="verse-num">9:5</span> <span class="verse-body">So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them:</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-6"><span class="verse-num">9:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:</span></p>

<p id="esther-9-12"><span class="verse-num">9:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-13"><span class="verse-num">9:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-14"><span class="verse-num">9:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict was hung up in Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-15"><span class="verse-num">9:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their substance.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-16"><span class="verse-num">9:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king's dominion the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were killed amounted to seventy-five thousand, and no man took any of their goods.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-17"><span class="verse-num">9:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holy day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-18"><span class="verse-num">9:18</span> <span class="verse-body">But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested.

<p id="esther-9-19"><span class="verse-num">9:19</span> <span class="verse-body">But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-20"><span class="verse-num">9:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in all the king's provinces, both those that lay near and those afar off,</span></p>

<p id="esther-9-22"><span class="verse-num">9:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats, and should give gifts to the poor.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-23"><span class="verse-num">9:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-24"><span class="verse-num">9:24</span> <span class="verse-body">For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy them; and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.</span></p>
<p id="esther-9-25"><span class="verse-num">9:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king's letters: and the evil that he had intended against the Jews, might return upon his own head.

<p id="esther-15-15"><span class="verse-num">15:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?</span></p>
<p id="esther-15-16"><span class="verse-num">15:16</span> <span class="verse-body">She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.</span></p>

<p id="esther-16-1"><span class="verse-num">16:1</span> <span class="verse-body">The great king Artaxerxes, from India to Ethiopia, to the governors and princes of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, which obey our command, sendeth greeting.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-2"><span class="verse-num">16:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Many have abused unto pride the goodness of princes, and the honour that hath been bestowed upon them:</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-3"><span class="verse-num">16:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And not only endeavour to oppress the king's subjects, but not bearing the glory that is given them, take in hand, to practise also against them that gave it.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-4"><span class="verse-num">16:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Neither are they content not to return thanks for benefits received, and to violate in themselves the laws of humanity, but they think they can also escape the justice of God who seeth all things.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-5"><span class="verse-num">16:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And they break out into so great madness, as to endeavour to undermine by lies such as observe diligently the offices committed to them, and do all things in such manner as to be worthy of all men's praise,</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-6"><span class="verse-num">16:6</span> <span class="verse-body">While with crafty fraud they deceive the ears of princes that are well meaning, and judge of others by their own nature.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-7"><span class="verse-num">16:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Now this is proved both from ancient histories, and by the things which are done daily, how the good designs of kings are depraved by the evil suggestions of certain men.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-8"><span class="verse-num">16:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-9"><span class="verse-num">16:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Neither must you think, if we command different things, that it cometh of the levity of our mind, but that we give sentence according to the quality and necessity of times, as the profit of the commonwealth requireth.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-10"><span class="verse-num">16:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Now that you may more plainly understand what we say, Aman the son of Amadathi, a Macedonian both in mind and country, and having nothing of the Persian blood, but with his cruelty staining our goodness, was received being a stranger by us:</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-11"><span class="verse-num">16:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And found our humanity so great towards him, that he was called our father, and was worshipped by all as the next man after the king:</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-12"><span class="verse-num">16:12</span> <span class="verse-body">But he was so far puffed up with arrogancy, as to go about to deprive us of our kingdom and life.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-13"><span class="verse-num">16:13</span> <span class="verse-body">For with certain new and unheard of devices he hath sought the destruction of Mardochai, by whose fidelity and good services our life was saved, and of Esther the partner of our kingdom with all their nation:</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-14"><span class="verse-num">16:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Thinking that after they were slain, he might work treason against us left alone without friends, and might transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-15"><span class="verse-num">16:15</span> <span class="verse-body">But we have found that the Jews, who were by that most wicked man appointed to be slain, are in no fault at all, but contrariwise, use just laws,</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-16"><span class="verse-num">16:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And are the children of the highest and the greatest, and the ever living God, by whose benefit the kingdom was given both to our fathers and to us, and is kept unto this day.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-17"><span class="verse-num">16:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore know ye that those letters which he sent in our name, are void and of no effect.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-18"><span class="verse-num">16:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For which crime both he himself that devised it, and all his kindred hang on gibbets, before the gates of this city Susan: not we, but God repaying him as he deserved.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-19"><span class="verse-num">16:19</span> <span class="verse-body">But this edict, which we now send, shall be published in all cities, that the Jews may freely follow their own laws.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-20"><span class="verse-num">16:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared themselves to kill them, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-21"><span class="verse-num">16:21</span> <span class="verse-body">For the almighty God hath turned this day of sadness and mourning into joy to them.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-22"><span class="verse-num">16:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival days, and celebrate it with all joy, that it may be known also in times to come,</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-23"><span class="verse-num">16:23</span> <span class="verse-body">That all they who faithfully obey the Persians, receive a worthy reward for their fidelity: but they that are traitors to their kingdom, are destroyed for their wickedness.</span></p>
<p id="esther-16-24"><span class="verse-num">16:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And let every province and city, that will not be partaker of this solemnity, perish by the sword and by fire, and be destroyed in such manner as to be made unpassable, both to men and beasts, for an example of contempt, and disobedience.</span></p>
