# AI Instructions: dwbible

## What it does

Renders the Latin Vulgate Bible on latinprayer.org in interlinear display
(two translations side by side). Owns all `/bible/`, `/bibel/`, `/latin/`,
`/latin-bible/`, `/latin-bibel/` URL namespaces, including routing,
rendering, JSON API, sitemaps, and OpenGraph meta.

## URL patterns

### Human-readable HTML pages

**Interlinear slugs** (two translations side by side):
- `latin-bibel` = Latin + German
- `latin-bible` = Latin + English

Single-language slugs (`/bible/`, `/bibel/`, `/latin/`) redirect 301 to
their interlinear counterpart. Use interlinear slugs for stable links.

**Patterns:**
```
/{slug}/{book}/                    book landing (chapter 1)
/{slug}/{book}/{chapter}/          full chapter
/{slug}/{book}/{chapter}:{verse}/  chapter with verse highlighted
/{slug}/{book}/{chapter}:{from}-{to}/  chapter with verse range highlighted
```

Verse references may be written with a **colon** or a **slash** — both resolve,
in every language and for ranges. The colon is canonical:

```
/en/biblia/ioannes/3:16     200  (direct)
/en/biblia/ioannes/3/16     301 → /en/biblia/ioannes/3:16/
```

So prefer the colon and you spend no redirect; use the slash and you spend one.
Under a legacy prefix (`/latin-bible/`, `/latin-bibel/`, `/bible/`) BOTH forms
redirect, because the prefix itself is what is being canonicalised — not the
separator.

What actually decides whether a citation resolves is the **prefix**, not the
separator: a bare `/ephesians/6:11/` 404s exactly like `/ephesians/6/11/` does.

Book slugs in HTML URLs follow the first language in the combo:
- `latin-bibel` → German names (prediger, psalmen, matthaus, markus …)
- `latin-bible` → English names (ecclesiastes, psalms, matthew, mark …)
Cross-language names also resolve — the router tries all datasets.

**Working examples** — the canonical shape is `/{lang}/biblia/{latin-book}/…`,
where the BOOK segment is always the Latin slug whatever the page language:
```
https://latinprayer.org/de/biblia/ephesios/6/          chapter, German
https://latinprayer.org/de/biblia/ephesios/6:11/       verse highlighted
https://latinprayer.org/de/biblia/ephesios/6:10-18/    range highlighted
https://latinprayer.org/en/biblia/ioannes/3:16/        Latin+English verse
https://latinprayer.org/de/biblia/ecclesiastes/1/      Ecclesiastes ch.1
https://latinprayer.org/de/biblia/psalmi/23/           Psalm 23
```

Vernacular book slugs still resolve and 301 to the canonical form — `prediger`,
`psalmen`, `juan`, `giovanni` all land correctly — so a citation built from a
reader's own language is safe. It just costs a redirect.

### JSON API

Programmatic access — no HTML, verse text only.

```
/{slug}/index.json                           all books for that translation
/{slug}/{book}/index.json                    chapter list for a book
/{slug}/{book}/{chapter}.json                all verses in a chapter
/{slug}/{book}/{chapter}/{verse}.json        single verse
/{slug}/{book}/{chapter}/{from}-{to}.json    verse range
/bible-index.json                            all books × all translations
```

JSON slugs: `bible` (Douay-Rheims / en), `latin` (Clementine Vulgate / la), `bibel` (Menge / de), `spanish` (Straubinger / es), `french` (Crampon / fr), `italian` (Martini / it).

## Key files

- `dwbible.php` — bootstrap, constants, rewrite rules, plugin init
- `includes/class-dwbible-router.php` — URL dispatch (`handle_request`)
- `includes/class-dwbible-render-interlinear.php` — interlinear page renderer
- `includes/class-dwbible-json-api.php` — JSON API endpoints + llms.txt serving
- `includes/class-dwbible-front-meta.php` — OpenGraph / JSON-LD meta
- `includes/class-dwbible-og-image.php` — dynamic OG image generation
- `includes/class-dwbible-data-paths.php` — resolves data directory paths
- `includes/class-dwbible-nav-helpers.php` — prev/next chapter navigation

## Data dependency

Requires the **dwbibledata** plugin. That plugin defines `DWBIBLEDATA_DIR`
and provides flat HTML + JSON files under `data/{dataset}/html/` and
`data/{dataset}/json/`. dwbible adds no DB tables — all content comes from
those files.

Datasets: `bible/`, `latin/`, `bibel/`, `spanish/`, `french/`, `italian/`
(single-language). Interlinear pages load and merge two datasets on the fly
(Latin + the vernacular for the current `/{lang}/` prefix).

## How to test

```bash
# PHP syntax check
php -l dwbible.php includes/class-dwbible-router.php

# HTML page (must return 200)
curl -o /dev/null -sw "%{http_code}\n" https://latinprayer.org/latin-bibel/ephesians/6:11/

# JSON API
curl https://latinprayer.org/bible/genesis/1.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -20

# llms.txt (AI documentation)
curl https://latinprayer.org/llms.txt
```

## SCSS build (reproducible)

Styles are authored in `assets/dwbible.scss` (+ `_`-prefixed partials) and compiled to the committed `assets/dwbible.css` with a **pinned dart-sass (1.99.0)** so the CSS never drifts between machines. Production ships the committed `.css` and needs no node.

```bash
npm ci            # install the pinned sass (do this FIRST — never build with a global sass)
npm run build:css # compiles assets/dwbible.scss -> assets/dwbible.css (a prebuild guard blocks a wrong-sass build)
git diff assets/dwbible.css   # review, then commit
```

A stray global sass reserializes `oklch()` + regroups selectors → a huge cosmetic diff that looks like drift (it isn't). The `prebuild:css` guard (`tools/check-sass-version.js`) aborts unless the pinned sass is installed.
