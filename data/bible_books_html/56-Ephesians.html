<p id="ephesians-5-1"><span class="verse-num">5:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-2"><span class="verse-num">5:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-3"><span class="verse-num">5:3</span> <span class="verse-body">But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-4"><span class="verse-num">5:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility, which is to no purpose: but rather giving of thanks.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-5"><span class="verse-num">5:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For know you this and understand: That no fornicator or unclean or covetous person (which is a serving of idols) hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-6"><span class="verse-num">5:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-7"><span class="verse-num">5:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-8"><span class="verse-num">5:8</span> <span class="verse-body">For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord.  Walk then as children of the light.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-9"><span class="verse-num">5:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-10"><span class="verse-num">5:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Proving what is well pleasing to God.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-11"><span class="verse-num">5:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness: but rather reprove them.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-12"><span class="verse-num">5:12</span> <span class="verse-body">For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-13"><span class="verse-num">5:13</span> <span class="verse-body">But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for all that is made manifest is light.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-14"><span class="verse-num">5:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore he saith: Rise, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.</span></p>

<p id="ephesians-5-16"><span class="verse-num">5:16</span> <span class="verse-body">But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-17"><span class="verse-num">5:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, become not unwise: but understanding what is the will of God.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-18"><span class="verse-num">5:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury: but be ye filled with the Holy Spirit,</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-19"><span class="verse-num">5:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-20"><span class="verse-num">5:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-21"><span class="verse-num">5:21</span> <span class="verse-body">Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-22"><span class="verse-num">5:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-23"><span class="verse-num">5:23</span> <span class="verse-body">Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-24"><span class="verse-num">5:24</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore as the church is subject to Christ: so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-25"><span class="verse-num">5:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and delivered himself up for it:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-26"><span class="verse-num">5:26</span> <span class="verse-body">That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-27"><span class="verse-num">5:27</span> <span class="verse-body">That he might present it to himself, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-28"><span class="verse-num">5:28</span> <span class="verse-body">So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.  He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-29"><span class="verse-num">5:29</span> <span class="verse-body">For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-30"><span class="verse-num">5:30</span> <span class="verse-body">Because we are members of him, body, of his flesh and of his bones.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-31"><span class="verse-num">5:31</span> <span class="verse-body">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother: and shall cleave to his wife. And they shall be two in one flesh.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-32"><span class="verse-num">5:32</span> <span class="verse-body">This is a great sacrament: but I speak in Christ and in the church.</span></p>
<p id="ephesians-5-33"><span class="verse-num">5:33</span> <span class="verse-body">Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular love for his wife as himself: And let the wife fear her husband.</span></p>
