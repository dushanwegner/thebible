<p id="hebrews-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all,</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">In these days, hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Who being the brightness of his glory and the figure of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high:</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Being made so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For to which of the angels hath he said at any time: Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.</span></p>

<p id="hebrews-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?</span></p>

<p id="hebrews-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard lest perhaps we should let them slip.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? Which, having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers miracles and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour and hast set him over the works of thy hands.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God he might taste death for all.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom God hath given me.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">For nowhere doth he take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest before God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted he is able to succour them also that are tempted.</span></p>

<p id="hebrews-3-1"><span class="verse-num">3:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-2"><span class="verse-num">3:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-3"><span class="verse-num">3:3</span> <span class="verse-body">For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house hath greater honour than the house.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-4"><span class="verse-num">3:4</span> <span class="verse-body">For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things is God.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-5"><span class="verse-num">3:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-6"><span class="verse-num">3:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But Christ, as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-7"><span class="verse-num">3:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To-day if you shall hear his voice,</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-8"><span class="verse-num">3:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the desert,</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-9"><span class="verse-num">3:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-10"><span class="verse-num">3:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-11"><span class="verse-num">3:11</span> <span class="verse-body">As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-12"><span class="verse-num">3:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-13"><span class="verse-num">3:13</span> <span class="verse-body">But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-14"><span class="verse-num">3:14</span> <span class="verse-body">For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-15"><span class="verse-num">3:15</span> <span class="verse-body">While it is said: To day, if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-16"><span class="verse-num">3:16</span> <span class="verse-body">For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-17"><span class="verse-num">3:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-18"><span class="verse-num">3:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-3-19"><span class="verse-num">3:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.</span></p>

<p id="hebrews-4-1"><span class="verse-num">4:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us fear therefore lest, the promise being left of entering into his rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-2"><span class="verse-num">4:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For unto us also it hath been declared in like manner as unto them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-3"><span class="verse-num">4:3</span> <span class="verse-body">For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-4"><span class="verse-num">4:4</span> <span class="verse-body">For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-5"><span class="verse-num">4:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-6"><span class="verse-num">4:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they to whom it was first preached did not enter because of unbelief:</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-7"><span class="verse-num">4:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David; To day, after so long a time as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-8"><span class="verse-num">4:8</span> <span class="verse-body">For if Jesus had given them rest he would never have afterwards spoken of another day.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-9"><span class="verse-num">4:9</span> <span class="verse-body">There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-10"><span class="verse-num">4:10</span> <span class="verse-body">For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-11"><span class="verse-num">4:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest: lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-12"><span class="verse-num">4:12</span> <span class="verse-body">For the word of God is living and effectual and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow: and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-13"><span class="verse-num">4:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-14"><span class="verse-num">4:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-15"><span class="verse-num">4:15</span> <span class="verse-body">For we have not a high priest who cannot have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-4-16"><span class="verse-num">4:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy and find grace in seasonable aid.</span></p>

<p id="hebrews-5-2"><span class="verse-num">5:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</span></p>

<p id="hebrews-5-11"><span class="verse-num">5:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-5-12"><span class="verse-num">5:12</span> <span class="verse-body">For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.</span></p>
<p id="hebrews-5-13"><span class="verse-num">5:13</span> <span class="verse-body">For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.</span></p>
