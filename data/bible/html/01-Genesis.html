<p id="genesis-19-2"><span class="verse-num">19:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in to the house of your servant, and lodge there: wash your feet, and in the morning you shall go on your way. And they said: No, but we will abide in the street.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-3"><span class="verse-num">19:3</span> <span class="verse-body">He pressed them very much to turn in unto him: and when they were come into his house, he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-4"><span class="verse-num">19:4</span> <span class="verse-body">But before they went to bed, the men of the city beset the house, both young and old, all the people together.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-5"><span class="verse-num">19:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And they called Lot, and said to him: Where are the men that came in to thee at night? bring them out hither, that we may know them:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-6"><span class="verse-num">19:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Lot went out to them, and shut the door after him, and said:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-7"><span class="verse-num">19:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do not commit this evil.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-8"><span class="verse-num">19:8</span> <span class="verse-body">I have two daughters who, as yet, have not known man; I will bring them out to you, and abuse you them as it shall please you, so that you do no evil to these men, because they are come in under the shadow of my roof.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-9"><span class="verse-num">19:9</span> <span class="verse-body">But they said: Get thee back thither. And again: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger, was it to be a judge? therefore we will afflict thee more than them. And they pressed very violently upon Lot: and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-10"><span class="verse-num">19:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And behold the men put out their hand, and drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-11"><span class="verse-num">19:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And them, that were without, they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest, so that they could not find the door.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-12"><span class="verse-num">19:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And they said to Lot: Hast thou here any of thine? son-in-law, or sons, or daughters, all that are thine bring them out of this city:</span></p>

<p id="genesis-19-17"><span class="verse-num">19:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And they brought him forth, and set him without the city: and there they spoke to him, saying: Save thy life: look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about: but save thy self in the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-18"><span class="verse-num">19:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And Lot said to them: I beseech thee, my Lord,</span></p>

<p id="genesis-19-20"><span class="verse-num">19:20</span> <span class="verse-body">There is this city here at hand, to which I may flee, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in it: is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-21"><span class="verse-num">19:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to him: Behold also in this, I have heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-22"><span class="verse-num">19:22</span> <span class="verse-body">Make haste, and be saved there: because I cannot do any thing till thou go in thither. Therefore the name of that city was called Segor.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-23"><span class="verse-num">19:23</span> <span class="verse-body">The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot entered into Segor.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-24"><span class="verse-num">19:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-25"><span class="verse-num">19:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And he destroyed these cities, and all the country about, all the inhabitants of the cities, and all things that spring from the earth.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-26"><span class="verse-num">19:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a statue of salt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-27"><span class="verse-num">19:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And Abraham got up early in the morning, and in the place where he had stood before with the Lord:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-28"><span class="verse-num">19:28</span> <span class="verse-body">He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and the whole land of that country: and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-29"><span class="verse-num">19:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when God destroyed the cities of that country, remembering Abraham, he delivered Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein he had dwelt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-30"><span class="verse-num">19:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode in the mountain, and his two daughters with him (for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-31"><span class="verse-num">19:31</span> <span class="verse-body">And the elder said to the younger: Our father is old, and there is no man left on the earth, to come in unto us after the manner of the whole earth.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-32"><span class="verse-num">19:32</span> <span class="verse-body">Come, let us make him drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-33"><span class="verse-num">19:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And they made their father drink wine that night: and the elder went in, and lay with her father: but he perceived not, neither when his daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-34"><span class="verse-num">19:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And the next day the elder said to the younger: Behold I lay last night with my father, let us make him drink wine also to night, and thou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed of our father.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-35"><span class="verse-num">19:35</span> <span class="verse-body">They made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in, and lay with him: and neither then did he perceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-36"><span class="verse-num">19:36</span> <span class="verse-body">So the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-37"><span class="verse-num">19:37</span> <span class="verse-body">And the elder bore a son, and she called his name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites unto this day.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-19-38"><span class="verse-num">19:38</span> <span class="verse-body">The younger also bore a son, and she called his name Ammon; that is, the son of my people: he is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.</span></p>

<p id="genesis-37-8"><span class="verse-num">37:8</span> <span class="verse-body">His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.</span></p>

<p id="genesis-38-15"><span class="verse-num">38:15</span> <span class="verse-body">When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she should be known.</span></p>

<p id="genesis-38-25"><span class="verse-num">38:25</span> <span class="verse-body">But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father-in-law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-38-26"><span class="verse-num">38:26</span> <span class="verse-body">But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However he knew her no more.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-38-27"><span class="verse-num">38:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-38-28"><span class="verse-num">38:28</span> <span class="verse-body">This shall come forth the first.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-38-29"><span class="verse-num">38:29</span> <span class="verse-body">But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-38-30"><span class="verse-num">38:30</span> <span class="verse-body">Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread: and she called his name Zara.</span></p>

<p id="genesis-40-15"><span class="verse-num">40:15</span> <span class="verse-body">For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-40-16"><span class="verse-num">40:16</span> <span class="verse-body">The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-40-17"><span class="verse-num">40:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.</span></p>

<p id="genesis-41-1"><span class="verse-num">41:1</span> <span class="verse-body">After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood by the river,</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-2"><span class="verse-num">41:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-3"><span class="verse-num">41:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Other seven also came up out of the river, ill-favoured, and lean fleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-4"><span class="verse-num">41:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao awoke.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-5"><span class="verse-num">41:5</span> <span class="verse-body">He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-6"><span class="verse-num">41:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-7"><span class="verse-num">41:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And devoured all the beauty of the former. Pharao awaked after his rest:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-8"><span class="verse-num">41:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-9"><span class="verse-num">41:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my sin:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-10"><span class="verse-num">41:10</span> <span class="verse-body">The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-11"><span class="verse-num">41:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-12"><span class="verse-num">41:12</span> <span class="verse-body">There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams,</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-13"><span class="verse-num">41:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-14"><span class="verse-num">41:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Forthwith at the king's command Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved him: and changing his apparel brought him in to him.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-15"><span class="verse-num">41:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-16"><span class="verse-num">41:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Joseph answered: Without me, God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-17"><span class="verse-num">41:17</span> <span class="verse-body">So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank of the river,</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-18"><span class="verse-num">41:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And seven kine came up out of the river, exceeding beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-19"><span class="verse-num">41:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill- favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-20"><span class="verse-num">41:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And they devoured and consumed the former,</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-21"><span class="verse-num">41:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill-favoured as before. I awoke, and then fell asleep again,</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-22"><span class="verse-num">41:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-23"><span class="verse-num">41:23</span> <span class="verse-body">Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stalk:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-24"><span class="verse-num">41:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And they devoured the beauty of the former: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-25"><span class="verse-num">41:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Joseph answered: The king's dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-26"><span class="verse-num">41:26</span> <span class="verse-body">The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-27"><span class="verse-num">41:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-28"><span class="verse-num">41:28</span> <span class="verse-body">Which shall be fulfilled in this order.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-29"><span class="verse-num">41:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-30"><span class="verse-num">41:30</span> <span class="verse-body">After which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the land,</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-31"><span class="verse-num">41:31</span> <span class="verse-body">And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-32"><span class="verse-num">41:32</span> <span class="verse-body">And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-33"><span class="verse-num">41:33</span> <span class="verse-body">Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-34"><span class="verse-num">41:34</span> <span class="verse-body">That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-35"><span class="verse-num">41:35</span> <span class="verse-body">That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up, under Pharao's hands, and be reserved in the cities.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-36"><span class="verse-num">41:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-37"><span class="verse-num">41:37</span> <span class="verse-body">The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his servants.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-38"><span class="verse-num">41:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-39"><span class="verse-num">41:39</span> <span class="verse-body">He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-40"><span class="verse-num">41:40</span> <span class="verse-body">Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-41"><span class="verse-num">41:41</span> <span class="verse-body">And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-42"><span class="verse-num">41:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-43"><span class="verse-num">41:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-44"><span class="verse-num">41:44</span> <span class="verse-body">And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao: without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-45"><span class="verse-num">41:45</span> <span class="verse-body">And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-46"><span class="verse-num">41:46</span> <span class="verse-body">(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao), and he went round all the countries of Egypt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-47"><span class="verse-num">41:47</span> <span class="verse-body">And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corn being bound up into sheaves, was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-48"><span class="verse-num">41:48</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-49"><span class="verse-num">41:49</span> <span class="verse-body">And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-50"><span class="verse-num">41:50</span> <span class="verse-body">And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-51"><span class="verse-num">41:51</span> <span class="verse-body">And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses, saying: God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father's house.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-52"><span class="verse-num">41:52</span> <span class="verse-body">And he named the second Ephraim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-53"><span class="verse-num">41:53</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in Egypt were passed:</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-54"><span class="verse-num">41:54</span> <span class="verse-body">The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-55"><span class="verse-num">41:55</span> <span class="verse-body">And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to Pharao, for food. And he said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that he shall say to you.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-56"><span class="verse-num">41:56</span> <span class="verse-body">And the famine increased daily in all the land: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed them also.</span></p>
<p id="genesis-41-57"><span class="verse-num">41:57</span> <span class="verse-body">And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want.</span></p>
