<p id="wisdom-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Love justice, you that are the judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world: and that which containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore he that speaketh unjust things, cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judgment pass him by.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly, and the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Keep yourselves, therefore, from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">For he created all things that they might be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">For justice is perpetual and immortal.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">But the wicked with works and words have called it to them: and esteeming it a friend, have fallen away and have made a covenant with it: because they are worthy to be of the part thereof.</span></p>

<p id="wisdom-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">For they have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right: The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For we are born of nothing, and after this we shall be as if we had not been: for the breath in our nostrils is smoke: and speech a spark to move our heart,</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Which being put out, our body shall be ashes, and our spirit shall be poured abroad as soft air, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, which is driven away by the beams of the sun, and overpowered with the heat thereof:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And our name in time shall be forgotten, and no man shall have any remembrance of our works.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For our time is as the passing of a shadow, and there is no going back of our end: for it is fast sealed, and no man returneth:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us fill ourselves with costly wine, and ointments: and let not the flower of the time pass by us.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us crown ourselves with roses, before they be withered: let no meadow escape our riot.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">Let none of us go without his part in luxury: let us every where leave tokens of joy: for this is our portion, and this our lot.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us oppress the poor just man, and not spare the widow, nor honour the ancient grey hairs of the aged.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">But let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us, therefore, lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us with transgressions of the law, and divulgeth against us the sins of our way of life.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">He is become a censurer of our thoughts.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">He is grievous unto us, even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, and his ways are very different.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the just, and glorieth that he hath God for his father.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us see then if his words be true, and let us prove what shall happen to him, and we shall know what his end shall be.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us examine him by outrages and tortures, that we may know his meekness, and try his patience.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Let us condemn him to a most shameful death: for there shall be respect had unto him by his words.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-21"><span class="verse-num">2:21</span> <span class="verse-body">These things they thought, and were deceived: for their own malice blinded them.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-22"><span class="verse-num">2:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And they knew not the secrets of God, nor hoped for the wages of justice, nor esteemed the honour of holy souls.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-23"><span class="verse-num">2:23</span> <span class="verse-body">For God created man incorruptible, and to the image of his own likeness he made him.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-2-24"><span class="verse-num">2:24</span> <span class="verse-body">But by the envy of the devil, death came into the world:</span></p>

<p id="wisdom-3-4"><span class="verse-num">3:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And though in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-3-5"><span class="verse-num">3:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Afflicted in few things, in many they shall be well rewarded: because God hath tried them, and found them worthy of himself.</span></p>

<p id="wisdom-4-8"><span class="verse-num">4:8</span> <span class="verse-body">For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man is grey hairs.</span></p>

<p id="wisdom-17-1"><span class="verse-num">17:1</span> <span class="verse-body">For thy judgments, O Lord, are great, and thy words cannot be expressed: therefore undisciplined souls have erred.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-2"><span class="verse-num">17:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For while the wicked thought to be able to have dominion over the holy nation, they themselves being fettered with the bonds of darkness, and a long night, shut up in their houses, lay there exiled from the eternal providence.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-3"><span class="verse-num">17:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And while they thought to lie hid in their obscure sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfullness, being horribly afraid, and troubled with exceeding great astonishment.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-4"><span class="verse-num">17:4</span> <span class="verse-body">For neither did the den that held them, keep them from fear: for noises coming down troubled them, and sad visions appearing to them, affrighted them.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-5"><span class="verse-num">17:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And no power of fire could give them light, neither could the bright flames of the stars enlighten that horrible night.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-6"><span class="verse-num">17:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But there appeared to them a sudden fire, very dreadful: and being struck with the fear of that face, which was not seen, they thought the things which they saw to be worse:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-7"><span class="verse-num">17:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And the delusions of their magic art were put down, and their boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-8"><span class="verse-num">17:8</span> <span class="verse-body">For they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of a fear worthy to be laughed at.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-9"><span class="verse-num">17:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For though no terrible thing disturbed them: yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear and denying that they saw the air, which could by no means be avoided.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-10"><span class="verse-num">17:10</span> <span class="verse-body">For whereas wickedness is fearful, it beareth witness of its condemnation: for a troubled conscience always forecasteth grievous things.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-11"><span class="verse-num">17:11</span> <span class="verse-body">For fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-12"><span class="verse-num">17:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And while there is less expectation from within, the greater doth it count the ignorance of that cause which bringeth the torment.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-13"><span class="verse-num">17:13</span> <span class="verse-body">But they that during that night, in which nothing could be done, and which came upon them from the lowest and deepest hell, slept the same sleep,</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-14"><span class="verse-num">17:14</span> <span class="verse-body">Were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters, sometimes fainted away, their soul failing them: for a sudden and unlooked for fear was come upon them.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-15"><span class="verse-num">17:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Moreover, if any of them had fallen down, he was kept shut up in prison without irons.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-16"><span class="verse-num">17:16</span> <span class="verse-body">For if any one were a husbandman, or a shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he endured a necessity from which he could not fly.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-17"><span class="verse-num">17:17</span> <span class="verse-body">For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence,</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-18"><span class="verse-num">17:18</span> <span class="verse-body">Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-19"><span class="verse-num">17:19</span> <span class="verse-body">For the whole world was enlightened, with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-17-20"><span class="verse-num">17:20</span> <span class="verse-body">But over them only was spread a heavy night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.</span></p>

<p id="wisdom-18-1"><span class="verse-num">18:1</span> <span class="verse-body">But thy saints had a very great light, and they heard their voice indeed, but did not see their shape. And because they also did not suffer the same things, they glorified thee:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-2"><span class="verse-num">18:2</span> <span class="verse-body">And they that before had been wronged, gave thanks, because they were not hurt now: and asked this gift, that there might be a difference.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-3"><span class="verse-num">18:3</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore they received a burning pillar of fire for a guide of the way which they knew not, and thou gavest them a harmless sun of a good entertainment.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-4"><span class="verse-num">18:4</span> <span class="verse-body">The others indeed were worthy to be deprived of light, and imprisoned in darkness, who kept thy children shut up, by whom the pure light of the law was to be given to the world.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-5"><span class="verse-num">18:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And whereas they thought to kill the babes of the just: one child being cast forth, and saved to reprove them, thou tookest away a multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-6"><span class="verse-num">18:6</span> <span class="verse-body">For that night was known before by our fathers, that assuredly knowing what oaths they had trusted to, they might be of better courage.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-7"><span class="verse-num">18:7</span> <span class="verse-body">So thy people received the salvation of the just, and destruction of the unjust.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-8"><span class="verse-num">18:8</span> <span class="verse-body">For as thou didst punish the adversaries so thou didst also encourage and glorify us.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-9"><span class="verse-num">18:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For the just children of good men were offering sacrifice secretly, and they unanimously ordered a law of justice: that the just should receive both good and evil alike, singing now the praises of the fathers.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-10"><span class="verse-num">18:10</span> <span class="verse-body">But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were bewailed.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-11"><span class="verse-num">18:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And the servant suffered the same punishment as the master, and a common man suffered in like manner as the king.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-12"><span class="verse-num">18:12</span> <span class="verse-body">So all alike had innumerable dead, with one kind of death. Neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-13"><span class="verse-num">18:13</span> <span class="verse-body">For whereas they would not believe any thing before by reason of the enchantments, then first upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged the people to be of God.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-14"><span class="verse-num">18:14</span> <span class="verse-body">For while all things were in quiet silence, and the night was in the midst of her course,</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-15"><span class="verse-num">18:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Thy Almighty word leaped down from heaven from thy royal throne, as a fierce conqueror into the midst of the land of destruction,</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-16"><span class="verse-num">18:16</span> <span class="verse-body">With a sharp sword carrying thy unfeigned commandment, and he stood and filled all things with death, and standing on the earth, reached even to heaven.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-17"><span class="verse-num">18:17</span> <span class="verse-body">Then suddenly visions of evil dreams troubled them, and fears unlooked for came upon them.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-18"><span class="verse-num">18:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And one thrown here, another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-19"><span class="verse-num">18:19</span> <span class="verse-body">For the visions that troubled them foreshewed these things, lest they should perish, and not know why they suffered these evils.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-20"><span class="verse-num">18:20</span> <span class="verse-body">But the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of death, and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness: but thy wrath did not long continue;</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-21"><span class="verse-num">18:21</span> <span class="verse-body">For a blameless man made haste to pry for the people, bringing forth the shield of his ministry, prayer, and by incense making supplication, withstood the wrath, and put an end to the calamity, shewing that he was thy servant.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-22"><span class="verse-num">18:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And he overcame the disturbance, not by strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him that punished them, alleging the oath and covenant made with the fathers.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-23"><span class="verse-num">18:23</span> <span class="verse-body">For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and cut off the way to the living.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-24"><span class="verse-num">18:24</span> <span class="verse-body">For in the priestly robe which he wore, was the whole world: and in the four rows of the stones, the glory of the fathers was graven, and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-18-25"><span class="verse-num">18:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And to these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for the proof only of wrath was enough.</span></p>

<p id="wisdom-19-1"><span class="verse-num">19:1</span> <span class="verse-body">But as to the wicked, even to the end there came upon them wrath without mercy. For he knew before also what they would do:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-2"><span class="verse-num">19:2</span> <span class="verse-body">For when they had given them leave to depart and had sent them away with great care, they repented and pursued after them.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-3"><span class="verse-num">19:3</span> <span class="verse-body">For whilst they were yet mourning, and lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another foolish device: and pursued them as fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-4"><span class="verse-num">19:4</span> <span class="verse-body">For a necessity, of which they were worthy, brought them to this end: and they lost the remembrance of those things which had happened, that their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-5"><span class="verse-num">19:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And that thy people might wonderfully pass through, but they might find a new death.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-6"><span class="verse-num">19:6</span> <span class="verse-body">For every creature, according to its kind was fashioned again as from the beginning, obeying thy commandments, that thy children might be kept without hurt.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-7"><span class="verse-num">19:7</span> <span class="verse-body">For a cloud overshadowed their camps and where water was before, dry land appeared, and in the Red Sea a way without hindrance, and out of the great deep a springing field:</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-8"><span class="verse-num">19:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Through which all the nation passed which was protected with thy hand, seeing thy miracles and wonders.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-9"><span class="verse-num">19:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For they fed on their food like horses, and they skipped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-10"><span class="verse-num">19:10</span> <span class="verse-body">For they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in the time of their sojourning, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-11"><span class="verse-num">19:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And at length they saw a new generation of birds, when being led by their appetite, they asked for delicate meats.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-12"><span class="verse-num">19:12</span> <span class="verse-body">For to satisfy their desire, the quail came up to them from the sea: and punishments came upon the sinners, not without foregoing signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-13"><span class="verse-num">19:13</span> <span class="verse-body">For they exercised a more detestable inhospitality than any: others indeed received not strangers unknown to them, but these brought their guests into bondage that had deserved well of them.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-14"><span class="verse-num">19:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And not only so, but in another respect also they were worse: for the others against their will received the strangers.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-15"><span class="verse-num">19:15</span> <span class="verse-body">But these grievously afflicted them whom they had received with joy, and who lived under the same laws.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-16"><span class="verse-num">19:16</span> <span class="verse-body">But they were struck with blindness: as those others were at the doors of the just man, when they were covered with sudden darkness, and every one sought the passage of his own door.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-17"><span class="verse-num">19:17</span> <span class="verse-body">For while the elements are changed in themselves, as in an instrument the sound of the quality is changed, yet all keep their sound: which may clearly be perceived by the very sight.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-18"><span class="verse-num">19:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For the things of the land were turned into things of the water: and the things that before swam in the water passed upon the land.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-19"><span class="verse-num">19:19</span> <span class="verse-body">The fire had power in water above its own virtue, and the water forgot its quenching nature.</span></p>
<p id="wisdom-19-20"><span class="verse-num">19:20</span> <span class="verse-body">On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of corruptible animals walking therein, neither did they melt that good food, which was apt to melt as ice. For in all things thou didst magnify thy people, O Lord, and didst honour them, and didst not despise them, but didst assist them at all times, and in every place.</span></p>
