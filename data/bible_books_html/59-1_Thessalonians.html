<p id="1-thessalonians-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">Knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also: and in the Holy Ghost and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And you became followers of us and of the Lord: receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and in Achaia but also in every place: your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had unto you: and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.</span></p>

<p id="1-thessalonians-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">But having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated, (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proveth our hearts.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery, as you know: nor taken an occasion of covetousness (God is witness):</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and without blame we have been to you that have believed:</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you (as a father doth his children),</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-14"><span class="verse-num">2:14</span> <span class="verse-body">For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews:</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-15"><span class="verse-num">2:15</span> <span class="verse-body">Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-16"><span class="verse-num">2:16</span> <span class="verse-body">Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-17"><span class="verse-num">2:17</span> <span class="verse-body">But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-18"><span class="verse-num">2:18</span> <span class="verse-body">For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-19"><span class="verse-num">2:19</span> <span class="verse-body">For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-2-20"><span class="verse-num">2:20</span> <span class="verse-body">For you are our glory and joy.</span></p>

<p id="1-thessalonians-3-5"><span class="verse-num">3:5</span> <span class="verse-body">For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you: and our labour should be made vain.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-3-6"><span class="verse-num">3:6</span> <span class="verse-body">But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you:</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-3-7"><span class="verse-num">3:7</span> <span class="verse-body">Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith.</span></p>
<p id="1-thessalonians-3-8"><span class="verse-num">3:8</span> <span class="verse-body">Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.</span></p>

<p id="1-thessalonians-4-3"><span class="verse-num">4:3</span> <span class="verse-body">For this is the will of God, your sanctification: That you should abstain from fornication:</span></p>

<p id="1-thessalonians-4-12"><span class="verse-num">4:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And we will not have you ignorant brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.</span></p>
