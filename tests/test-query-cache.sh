# test-query-cache.sh — a typed Bible search must never become the Bible index.
#
# WHAT:  Asks for `/{lang}/biblia/?q=<something>` and then for the plain index,
#        and asserts the index came back as the index. dwcache builds its key
#        from the URL with unknown query params STRIPPED, so a parameter that
#        changes the response has to be added to its allow-list — otherwise the
#        two URLs share one entry and break in both directions: the lookup is
#        answered with the cached index, and the lookup's answer is stored AS
#        the index for every visitor. That shipped for a few minutes on
#        2026-08-28; this is the guard.
#
# INPUT: BASE_URL argv[1] — default https://latinprayer.org. Run it against
#        PRODUCTION: the bug only exists where a page cache is on (dwcache is
#        off outside wp_get_environment_type() === 'production').
# OUTPUT: one ok/FAIL line per case; exit 1 on any failure.
#
# USAGE: ./tests/test-query-cache.sh [BASE_URL]
#
# DEPENDS ON: curl (-k, so the local site's self-signed cert is no obstacle).
# TESTED BY: itself — poison first, then read the index back.
