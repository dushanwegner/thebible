<p id="luke-1-1"><span class="verse-num">1:1</span> <span class="verse-body">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of the things that have been accomplished among us,</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-2"><span class="verse-num">1:2</span> <span class="verse-body">According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word:</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all things from the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been instructed.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zachary, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren: and they both were well advanced in years.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the order of his course before God,</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to offer incense, going into the temple of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the hour of incense.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And Zachary seeing him, was troubled: and fear fell upon him.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is heard: and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son.  And thou shalt call his name John.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">And thou shalt have joy and gladness: and many shall rejoice in his nativity.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">For he shall be great before the Lord and shall drink no wine nor strong drink: and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias: that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">And Zachary said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this?  For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">And the angel answering, said to him: I am Gabriel, who stand before God and am sent to speak to thee and to bring thee these good tidings.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">And behold, thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass: because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And the people were waiting for Zachary: and they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them and remained dumb.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-23"><span class="verse-num">1:23</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-24"><span class="verse-num">1:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself five months, saying:</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-25"><span class="verse-num">1:25</span> <span class="verse-body">Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-26"><span class="verse-num">1:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-27"><span class="verse-num">1:27</span> <span class="verse-body">To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David: and the virgin's name was Mary.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-28"><span class="verse-num">1:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-29"><span class="verse-num">1:29</span> <span class="verse-body">Who having heard, was troubled at his saying and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-30"><span class="verse-num">1:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-31"><span class="verse-num">1:31</span> <span class="verse-body">Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-32"><span class="verse-num">1:32</span> <span class="verse-body">He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-33"><span class="verse-num">1:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-34"><span class="verse-num">1:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man?</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-35"><span class="verse-num">1:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-36"><span class="verse-num">1:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-37"><span class="verse-num">1:37</span> <span class="verse-body">Because no word shall be impossible with God.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-38"><span class="verse-num">1:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it done to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-39"><span class="verse-num">1:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-40"><span class="verse-num">1:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And she entered into the house of Zachary and saluted Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-41"><span class="verse-num">1:41</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-42"><span class="verse-num">1:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And she cried out with a loud voice and said: Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-43"><span class="verse-num">1:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-44"><span class="verse-num">1:44</span> <span class="verse-body">For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-45"><span class="verse-num">1:45</span> <span class="verse-body">And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-46"><span class="verse-num">1:46</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-47"><span class="verse-num">1:47</span> <span class="verse-body">And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-48"><span class="verse-num">1:48</span> <span class="verse-body">Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-49"><span class="verse-num">1:49</span> <span class="verse-body">Because he that is mighty hath done great things to me: and holy is his name.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-50"><span class="verse-num">1:50</span> <span class="verse-body">And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-51"><span class="verse-num">1:51</span> <span class="verse-body">He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-52"><span class="verse-num">1:52</span> <span class="verse-body">He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the humble.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-53"><span class="verse-num">1:53</span> <span class="verse-body">He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath sent empty away.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-54"><span class="verse-num">1:54</span> <span class="verse-body">He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-55"><span class="verse-num">1:55</span> <span class="verse-body">As he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-56"><span class="verse-num">1:56</span> <span class="verse-body">And Mary abode with her about three months. And she returned to her own house.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-57"><span class="verse-num">1:57</span> <span class="verse-body">Now Elizabeth's full time of being delivered was come: and she brought forth a son.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-58"><span class="verse-num">1:58</span> <span class="verse-body">And her neighbors and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great mercy towards her: and they congratulated with her.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-59"><span class="verse-num">1:59</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child: and they called him by his father's name Zachary.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-60"><span class="verse-num">1:60</span> <span class="verse-body">And his mother answering, said: Not so. But he shall be called John.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-61"><span class="verse-num">1:61</span> <span class="verse-body">And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-62"><span class="verse-num">1:62</span> <span class="verse-body">And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-63"><span class="verse-num">1:63</span> <span class="verse-body">And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying: John is his name. And they all wondered.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-64"><span class="verse-num">1:64</span> <span class="verse-body">And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed: and he spoke, blessing God.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-65"><span class="verse-num">1:65</span> <span class="verse-body">And fear came upon all their neighbours: and all these things were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-66"><span class="verse-num">1:66</span> <span class="verse-body">And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying: What an one, think ye, shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-67"><span class="verse-num">1:67</span> <span class="verse-body">And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost. And he prophesied, saying:</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-68"><span class="verse-num">1:68</span> <span class="verse-body">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people.</span></p>

<p id="luke-1-70"><span class="verse-num">1:70</span> <span class="verse-body">As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the beginning.</span></p>
<p id="luke-1-71"><span class="verse-num">1:71</span> <span class="verse-body">Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us.</span></p>

<p id="luke-1-76"><span class="verse-num">1:76</span> <span class="verse-body">And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt, go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:</span></p>

<p id="luke-18-2"><span class="verse-num">18:2</span> <span class="verse-body">Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God nor regarded man.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-3"><span class="verse-num">18:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-4"><span class="verse-num">18:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God nor regard man,</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-5"><span class="verse-num">18:5</span> <span class="verse-body">Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-6"><span class="verse-num">18:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-7"><span class="verse-num">18:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night? And will he have patience in their regard?</span></p>

<p id="luke-18-9"><span class="verse-num">18:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And to some who trusted in themselves as just and despised others, he spoke also this parable:</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-10"><span class="verse-num">18:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-11"><span class="verse-num">18:11</span> <span class="verse-body">The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-12"><span class="verse-num">18:12</span> <span class="verse-body">I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.</span></p>

<p id="luke-18-14"><span class="verse-num">18:14</span> <span class="verse-body">I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-15"><span class="verse-num">18:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-16"><span class="verse-num">18:16</span> <span class="verse-body">But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</span></p>

<p id="luke-18-23"><span class="verse-num">18:23</span> <span class="verse-body">He having heard these things, became sorrowful: for he was very rich.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-24"><span class="verse-num">18:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-25"><span class="verse-num">18:25</span> <span class="verse-body">For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span></p>

<p id="luke-18-32"><span class="verse-num">18:32</span> <span class="verse-body">For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles and shall be mocked and scourged and spit upon.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-33"><span class="verse-num">18:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death. And the third day he shall rise again.</span></p>

<p id="luke-18-35"><span class="verse-num">18:35</span> <span class="verse-body">Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-36"><span class="verse-num">18:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-37"><span class="verse-num">18:37</span> <span class="verse-body">And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-38"><span class="verse-num">18:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And he cried out, saying: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-39"><span class="verse-num">18:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-40"><span class="verse-num">18:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him.  And when he was come near, he asked him,</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-41"><span class="verse-num">18:41</span> <span class="verse-body">Saying; What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-42"><span class="verse-num">18:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.</span></p>
<p id="luke-18-43"><span class="verse-num">18:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And immediately he saw and followed him, glorifying God.  And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</span></p>

<p id="luke-23-8"><span class="verse-num">23:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And Herod seeing Jesus, was very glad: for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-9"><span class="verse-num">23:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.</span></p>

<p id="luke-23-23"><span class="verse-num">23:23</span> <span class="verse-body">But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-24"><span class="verse-num">23:24</span> <span class="verse-body">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-25"><span class="verse-num">23:25</span> <span class="verse-body">And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition had been cast into prison, whom they had desired. But Jesus he delivered up to their will.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-26"><span class="verse-num">23:26</span> <span class="verse-body">And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-27"><span class="verse-num">23:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And there followed him a great multitude of people and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.</span></p>

<p id="luke-23-33"><span class="verse-num">23:33</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there: and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-34"><span class="verse-num">23:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-35"><span class="verse-num">23:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others: let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-36"><span class="verse-num">23:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,</span></p>

<p id="luke-23-40"><span class="verse-num">23:40</span> <span class="verse-body">But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing; thou art under the same condemnation?</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-41"><span class="verse-num">23:41</span> <span class="verse-body">And we indeed justly: for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man hath done no evil.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-42"><span class="verse-num">23:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-43"><span class="verse-num">23:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee: This day thou shalt be with me in paradise.</span></p>

<p id="luke-23-47"><span class="verse-num">23:47</span> <span class="verse-body">Now, the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man.</span></p>

<p id="luke-23-52"><span class="verse-num">23:52</span> <span class="verse-body">This man went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.</span></p>
<p id="luke-23-53"><span class="verse-num">23:53</span> <span class="verse-body">And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.</span></p>
