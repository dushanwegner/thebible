<p id="mark-1-27"><span class="verse-num">1:27</span> <span class="verse-body">And they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? What is this new doctrine? For with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits: and they obey him.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-28"><span class="verse-num">1:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-29"><span class="verse-num">1:29</span> <span class="verse-body">And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-30"><span class="verse-num">1:30</span> <span class="verse-body">And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.</span></p>

<p id="mark-1-34"><span class="verse-num">1:34</span> <span class="verse-body">And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases.  And he cast out many devils: and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-35"><span class="verse-num">1:35</span> <span class="verse-body">And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-36"><span class="verse-num">1:36</span> <span class="verse-body">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-37"><span class="verse-num">1:37</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-38"><span class="verse-num">1:38</span> <span class="verse-body">And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-39"><span class="verse-num">1:39</span> <span class="verse-body">And he was preaching in their synagogues and in all Galilee and casting out devils.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-40"><span class="verse-num">1:40</span> <span class="verse-body">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him and kneeling down, said to him: If thou wilt thou canst make me clean.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-41"><span class="verse-num">1:41</span> <span class="verse-body">And Jesus, having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand and touching him saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-42"><span class="verse-num">1:42</span> <span class="verse-body">And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him: and he was made clean.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-43"><span class="verse-num">1:43</span> <span class="verse-body">And he strictly charged him and forthwith sent him away.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-44"><span class="verse-num">1:44</span> <span class="verse-body">And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span></p>
<p id="mark-1-45"><span class="verse-num">1:45</span> <span class="verse-body">But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places. And they flocked to him from all sides.</span></p>
