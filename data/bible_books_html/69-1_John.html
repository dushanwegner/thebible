And you have no need that any man teach you: but as his unction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him.</span></p>
<p id="1-john-2-28"><span class="verse-num">2:28</span> <span class="verse-body">And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming.</span></p>
