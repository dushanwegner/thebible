<p id="job-1-3"><span class="verse-num">1:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a family exceedingly great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-4"><span class="verse-num">1:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-5"><span class="verse-num">1:5</span> <span class="verse-body">And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early, offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-6"><span class="verse-num">1:6</span> <span class="verse-body">Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-7"><span class="verse-num">1:7</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-8"><span class="verse-num">1:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?</span></p>
<p id="job-1-9"><span class="verse-num">1:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?</span></p>
<p id="job-1-10"><span class="verse-num">1:10</span> <span class="verse-body">Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?</span></p>
<p id="job-1-11"><span class="verse-num">1:11</span> <span class="verse-body">But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he bless thee not to thy face.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-12"><span class="verse-num">1:12</span> <span class="verse-body">Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-13"><span class="verse-num">1:13</span> <span class="verse-body">Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,</span></p>
<p id="job-1-14"><span class="verse-num">1:14</span> <span class="verse-body">There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,</span></p>
<p id="job-1-15"><span class="verse-num">1:15</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-16"><span class="verse-num">1:16</span> <span class="verse-body">And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-17"><span class="verse-num">1:17</span> <span class="verse-body">And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-18"><span class="verse-num">1:18</span> <span class="verse-body">He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,</span></p>
<p id="job-1-19"><span class="verse-num">1:19</span> <span class="verse-body">A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-20"><span class="verse-num">1:20</span> <span class="verse-body">Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</span></p>
<p id="job-1-21"><span class="verse-num">1:21</span> <span class="verse-body">And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p id="job-1-22"><span class="verse-num">1:22</span> <span class="verse-body">In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.</span></p>

<p id="job-2-1"><span class="verse-num">2:1</span> <span class="verse-body">And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came amongst them, and stood in his sight,</span></p>
<p id="job-2-2"><span class="verse-num">2:2</span> <span class="verse-body">That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou?  And he answered, and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-3"><span class="verse-num">2:3</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence? But thou hast moved me against him, that I should afflict him without cause.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-4"><span class="verse-num">2:4</span> <span class="verse-body">And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin; and all that a man hath, he will give for his life:</span></p>
<p id="job-2-5"><span class="verse-num">2:5</span> <span class="verse-body">But put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and then thou shalt see that he will bless thee to thy face.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-6"><span class="verse-num">2:6</span> <span class="verse-body">And the Lord said to Satan: Behold, he is in thy hand, but yet save his life.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-7"><span class="verse-num">2:7</span> <span class="verse-body">So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:</span></p>
<p id="job-2-8"><span class="verse-num">2:8</span> <span class="verse-body">And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-9"><span class="verse-num">2:9</span> <span class="verse-body">And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? bless God and die.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-10"><span class="verse-num">2:10</span> <span class="verse-body">And he said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women: If we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil?  In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-11"><span class="verse-num">2:11</span> <span class="verse-body">Now when Job's three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Themanite, and Baldad, the Suhite, and Sophar, the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, and comfort him.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-12"><span class="verse-num">2:12</span> <span class="verse-body">And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out, they wept, and rending their garments, they sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</span></p>
<p id="job-2-13"><span class="verse-num">2:13</span> <span class="verse-body">And they sat with him on the ground seven day and seven nights and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great.</span></p>
